00:01:30:16,00:01:31:16,Hey!
00:03:16:07,00:03:17:23,We live in a twilight world.
00:03:19:24,00:03:21:16,We live in a twilight world.
00:03:22:07,00:03:23:16,And there are no friends at dusk.
00:03:23:20,00:03:26:18,You've been made. This siege is a blind for them to vanish you.
00:03:32:02,00:03:33:16,But I established contact.
00:03:33:20,00:03:35:01,Bring you in or kill you.
00:03:35:05,00:03:37:15,You have two minutes. Make up your mind.
00:03:42:15,00:03:43:18,Where's the package?
00:03:43:22,00:03:45:02,Coat check.
00:04:09:16,00:04:10:16,Stay.
00:04:37:06,00:04:38:17,"No friends at dusk, huh?"
00:04:38:18,00:04:39:14,You'll do.
00:04:39:18,00:04:41:04,Get him to the rally point.
00:05:13:06,00:05:16:00,Swap clothes. The Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.
00:05:16:09,00:05:17:23,I've never seen encapsulation like this.
00:05:18:04,00:05:20:06,"We don't know how old it is, but it's the real deal."
00:05:20:10,00:05:21:10,Did you have an out?
00:05:21:11,00:05:22:21,Service tunnel to the sewer.
00:05:23:08,00:05:26:15,Take this. Take him. Take his exit. I don't trust ours anymore.
00:05:26:19,00:05:27:15,Can you defuse that?
00:05:27:19,00:05:29:12,It's centrally synchronized. Are there more?
00:05:29:14,00:05:30:10,Covering their tracks.
00:05:30:14,00:05:32:05,- Taking out the audience? - They're just the cheap seats.
00:05:32:06,00:05:33:13,That's not our mission.
00:05:33:14,00:05:34:16,Mine now.
00:06:00:04,00:06:01:04,Walk away.
00:06:05:03,00:06:07:03,You don't have to kill these people.
00:06:19:23,00:06:20:23,That wasn't one of us.
00:06:21:03,00:06:22:12,I'll take the help.
00:06:24:15,00:06:25:15,"Go, go, go."
00:06:56:13,00:06:59:16,"A man can be trained to hold out for about 18 hours,"
00:06:59:20,00:07:02:19,so your colleagues will be clear by 7:00.
00:07:09:02,00:07:10:20,He didn't last 18 minutes.
00:07:10:23,00:07:12:18,He didn't have anything to hide.
00:07:12:22,00:07:15:05,You were smuggling a nobody.
00:07:18:06,00:07:19:22,It's risky.
00:07:23:07,00:07:25:12,Or were you counting on this?
00:07:25:17,00:07:26:22,Death.
00:07:27:02,00:07:28:24,CIA issue.
00:07:36:07,00:07:39:09,"Spare yourself, once they clear."
00:07:53:18,00:07:55:12,Almost 7:00.
00:07:55:22,00:07:57:03,Uh-oh.
00:08:02:08,00:08:03:22,It's running fast.
00:08:07:21,00:08:10:05,We have to put it back one hour.
00:08:29:18,00:08:31:04,Get it out!
00:08:55:01,00:08:57:06,Welcome to the afterlife.
00:08:57:22,00:09:00:05,You've been in a medically-induced coma
00:09:00:09,00:09:03:22,while we got you out of Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.
00:09:04:02,00:09:08:03,The suicide pills are fake.
00:09:09:00,00:09:10:07,Why?
00:09:10:11,00:09:11:14,A test.
00:09:12:02,00:09:13:06,A test?
00:09:16:14,00:09:18:11,They pulled my teeth out.
00:09:20:00,00:09:22:05,Did my team get clear?
00:09:23:01,00:09:24:06,No.
00:09:24:16,00:09:26:13,"Private Russians, we think."
00:09:27:14,00:09:29:11,Somebody talked.
00:09:30:13,00:09:31:15,Not you.
00:09:32:07,00:09:35:05,You chose to die instead of giving up your colleagues.
00:09:44:06,00:09:47:02,We all believe we'd run into the burning building.
00:09:48:06,00:09:52:07,"But until we feel that heat, we can never know."
00:09:52:11,00:09:53:16,You do.
00:09:59:18,00:10:01:12,I resign.
00:10:01:16,00:10:04:01,You don't work for us. You're dead.
00:10:05:08,00:10:08:02,Your duty transcends national interests.
00:10:08:07,00:10:10:00,This is about survival.
00:10:12:10,00:10:13:12,Whose?
00:10:16:03,00:10:17:11,Everyone's.
00:10:20:01,00:10:22:04,"There's a cold war, cold as ice."
00:10:23:10,00:10:26:22,To even know its true nature is to lose.
00:10:27:02,00:10:28:13,This is knowledge divided.
00:10:28:17,00:10:32:08,All I have for you is a gesture
00:10:32:12,00:10:34:16,in combination with a word.
00:10:34:20,00:10:35:23,"""Tenet."""
00:10:37:19,00:10:39:02,Use it carefully.
00:10:40:20,00:10:43:21,"It'll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones, too."
00:10:44:01,00:10:45:23,That's all they've told you?
00:10:47:06,00:10:48:16,That test you passed?
00:10:50:12,00:10:51:14,Not everybody does.
00:13:04:19,00:13:09:04,"With a high-vis vest and a clipboard, you can get almost anywhere."
00:13:09:08,00:13:10:23,Almost.
00:13:11:21,00:13:13:02,An obscure tenet.
00:13:22:00,00:13:22:20,No small talk.
00:13:23:00,00:13:25:03,Nothing that might reveal who we are or what we do.
00:13:25:19,00:13:27:20,I thought I was here to find out what we do.
00:13:28:14,00:13:31:02,"You're not here for ""what,"" you're here for ""how."""
00:13:31:06,00:13:34:09,"""What"" is your department and not my business."
00:13:34:14,00:13:36:04,"Well, to do what I do..."
00:13:36:23,00:13:39:05,I need some idea of the threat we face.
00:13:42:01,00:13:45:13,"As I understand it, we're trying to prevent world war lll."
00:13:45:17,00:13:47:09,Nuclear holocaust?
00:13:47:22,00:13:48:23,No.
00:13:50:12,00:13:52:01,Something worse.
00:14:01:09,00:14:02:15,Aim it and pull the trigger.
00:14:04:17,00:14:05:17,It's empty.
00:14:05:21,00:14:06:21,Aim it.
00:14:12:18,00:14:13:22,Check the magazine.
00:14:18:08,00:14:19:13,How?
00:14:25:05,00:14:28:21,"One of these bullets is like us, traveling forwards through time."
00:14:29:11,00:14:31:18,The other one's going backwards.
00:14:32:05,00:14:34:10,Can you tell which is which?
00:14:36:07,00:14:37:19,How about now?
00:14:38:10,00:14:41:00,It's inverted. Its entropy runs backwards.
00:14:41:04,00:14:44:04,"So, to our eyes, its movement is reversed."
00:14:44:08,00:14:47:11,We think it's a type of inverse radiation triggered by nuclear fission.
00:14:47:15,00:14:48:15,You didn't make it?
00:14:48:18,00:14:49:23,"No, we don't know how yet."
00:14:50:03,00:14:51:11,"So, where'd it come from?"
00:14:51:15,00:14:53:18,Someone's manufacturing them in the future.
00:14:53:22,00:14:55:20,They're streaming back at us.
00:14:56:00,00:14:57:04,Try it.
00:15:04:11,00:15:06:04,You have to have dropped it.
00:15:18:06,00:15:20:04,How can it move before I touch it?
00:15:20:08,00:15:22:18,"From your point of view, you caught it."
00:15:22:22,00:15:25:02,"But from the bullet's point of view, you dropped it."
00:15:25:06,00:15:26:24,But cause comes before effect.
00:15:27:04,00:15:29:13,"No, that's just the way we see time."
00:15:30:06,00:15:31:21,"Well, what about free will?"
00:15:32:01,00:15:34:16,That bullet wouldn't have moved if you hadn't put your hand there.
00:15:34:17,00:15:37:14,"Either way we run the tape, you made it happen."
00:15:38:21,00:15:40:14,Don't try to understand it.
00:15:41:22,00:15:43:03,Feel it.
00:15:53:15,00:15:54:18,Instinct.
00:15:56:12,00:15:57:15,Got it.
00:16:02:11,00:16:04:11,Why does it feel so strange?
00:16:05:15,00:16:07:19,"You're not shooting the bullet,"
00:16:07:23,00:16:09:08,you're catching it.
00:16:11:00,00:16:12:13,Whoa.
00:16:15:05,00:16:17:02,I've seen this type of ammunition before.
00:16:17:06,00:16:18:06,In the field?
00:16:18:08,00:16:19:12,I was almost hit.
00:16:19:16,00:16:21:08,Then you were exceedingly lucky.
00:16:22:05,00:16:24:22,An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating.
00:16:25:03,00:16:26:08,Not pretty.
00:16:28:01,00:16:29:03,These look like today's.
00:16:29:07,00:16:31:13,They may have been made today and inverted years from now.
00:16:31:16,00:16:32:16,Where did you get them?
00:16:32:21,00:16:36:15,"Came with the wall. I was assigned it, like all the material I'm studying here."
00:16:36:19,00:16:38:08,Do you have an analysis on the metals?
00:16:38:12,00:16:40:06,Sure. Why?
00:16:40:10,00:16:42:21,The mixture of alloys can tell me where they might have been made.
00:16:42:22,00:16:44:07,Look...
00:16:45:17,00:16:47:07,I'm not seeing armageddon here.
00:16:50:00,00:16:52:12,"The bullet may not seem like much, but it's a simple machine."
00:16:52:16,00:16:55:12,"Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder."
00:16:56:10,00:16:57:10,"If they can invert that,"
00:16:57:12,00:16:59:19,I see no reason they couldn't invert pretty much anything.
00:16:59:23,00:17:03:00,Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future.
00:17:03:05,00:17:06:17,An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.
00:17:10:13,00:17:14:08,"Now that we know what to look for, we're finding more and more inverted material."
00:17:14:24,00:17:17:19,Remnants of complex objects.
00:17:21:05,00:17:22:14,What do you think we're seeing?
00:17:24:16,00:17:27:01,The detritus of a coming war.
00:17:46:06,00:17:48:05,#NAME?
00:17:48:06,00:17:50:11,No friends at dusk. I was told you left the building.
00:17:50:16,00:17:52:00,Even the dead need allies.
00:17:52:05,00:17:53:09,Specifically?
00:17:53:23,00:17:56:22,I need an assist in Mumbai. I need to get to Sanjay Singh.
00:17:57:02,00:17:58:02,Singh?
00:17:58:04,00:17:59:23,He never leaves his house. And his house is...
00:18:00:13,00:18:01:13,#NAME?
00:18:01:17,00:18:03:03,I'm looking right at it.
00:18:03:07,00:18:04:22,I'll see who's on deck.
00:18:05:02,00:18:07:02,Bombay yacht club in two hours.
00:18:19:10,00:18:20:18,It seems you need an introduction
00:18:20:19,00:18:23:23,to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice.
00:18:25:05,00:18:26:05,I'm Neil.
00:18:26:10,00:18:28:09,I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.
00:18:30:20,00:18:31:20,That's not possible.
00:18:32:01,00:18:34:09,Ten minutes tops.
00:18:35:01,00:18:36:15,Time isn't the problem.
00:18:37:16,00:18:39:19,It's getting out alive that's the problem.
00:18:42:16,00:18:45:24,Would you take a child hostage? A woman?
00:18:46:04,00:18:47:08,If I had to.
00:18:47:12,00:18:49:02,I'm not looking to make much noise here.
00:18:49:15,00:18:50:11,Yes?
00:18:50:15,00:18:53:12,Vodka tonic. And a diet coke.
00:18:55:21,00:18:56:23,What?
00:18:58:01,00:18:59:03,You never drink on the job.
00:18:59:05,00:19:00:18,You're well-informed.
00:19:00:22,00:19:04:11,"Well, pays to be in our profession."
00:19:04:15,00:19:06:13,"Well, I prefer soda water."
00:19:09:01,00:19:10:10,"No, you don't."
00:19:11:13,00:19:13:09,How's your parachuting?
00:19:13:14,00:19:15:10,I broke an ankle during basic training.
00:19:15:14,00:19:18:09,Singh's house isn't tall enough to parachute off of.
00:19:18:19,00:19:19:21,It's bungee-jumpable.
00:19:20:01,00:19:22:13,"I don't think ""bungee-jumpable” is a word."
00:19:22:17,00:19:25:12,"It may not be a word, but it may be our only way out of that place."
00:19:26:21,00:19:28:17,"Or into it, for that matter."
00:20:08:08,00:20:10:22,I know you're tired. I'm also very tired.
00:21:13:12,00:21:14:22,Stay back.
00:21:15:03,00:21:18:11,I was almost taken out by a very unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.
00:21:18:15,00:21:21:11,I want to know who supplied it.
00:21:21:16,00:21:23:06,My name is Sanjay.
00:21:23:11,00:21:24:14,And you are?
00:21:25:16,00:21:27:11,No chitchat?
00:21:27:14,00:21:30:21,"There's no one at the other end. No one who's gonna help you, anyway."
00:21:32:20,00:21:34:09,Don't let it get cold.
00:21:36:11,00:21:38:09,Why should I know who supplied it?
00:21:38:13,00:21:41:11,Combination of metals is unique to India.
00:21:41:15,00:21:42:19,"If it's from India, it's from you."
00:21:42:19,00:21:44:11,#NAME?
00:21:44:15,00:21:46:01,"Deduction, then."
00:21:46:05,00:21:47:19,"Look, my friend..."
00:21:47:23,00:21:50:20,Guns are never conducive to a productive negotiation.
00:21:51:00,00:21:53:12,I'm not the man they send to negotiate.
00:21:54:21,00:21:56:06,Or the man they send to make deals.
00:21:56:21,00:21:59:18,But I am the man people talk to.
00:22:01:15,00:22:02:20,I can't.
00:22:03:03,00:22:04:05,I can't tell you.
00:22:04:09,00:22:05:10,"You're an arms dealer, friend."
00:22:05:11,00:22:07:20,This may be the easiest trigger I've ever had to pull.
00:22:08:18,00:22:10:11,To say anything about a client
00:22:10:15,00:22:12:20,would violate the tenets he lives by.
00:22:13:23,00:22:16:16,"If tenets are important to you, then you can tell me."
00:22:17:13,00:22:18:13,Everything.
00:22:18:20,00:22:21:01,Not while you have a gun to my husband's head.
00:22:22:06,00:22:25:04,"Sanjay, make a drink for our guest, please."
00:22:25:19,00:22:26:19,Cheers.
00:22:27:09,00:22:29:02,Priya. Hmm.
00:22:29:13,00:22:31:04,This is your operation?
00:22:31:18,00:22:34:19,A masculine front in a man's world has its uses.
00:22:34:23,00:22:36:21,The dealer you're looking for is andrei sator.
00:22:37:08,00:22:38:10,The Russian oligarch.
00:22:38:15,00:22:40:05,#NAME?
00:22:40:16,00:22:42:18,Made his billions in gas.
00:22:42:22,00:22:46:05,Moved to London. Said to be on the outs with Moscow.
00:22:46:09,00:22:48:01,Very good.
00:22:48:05,00:22:50:19,Except the gas he made his billions from was actually plutonium.
00:22:51:11,00:22:55:04,None of which explains how or why you sold him inverted munitions.
00:22:55:08,00:22:57:16,"When I sold him the rounds, they were perfectly ordinary."
00:22:57:20,00:22:59:07,So how did he get them inverted?
00:23:00:09,00:23:03:02,We believe he's functioning as some sort of a broker.
00:23:03:06,00:23:05:06,Between our time and the future.
00:23:06:18,00:23:08:09,He can communicate with the future?
00:23:08:13,00:23:10:01,"We all do, don't we?"
00:23:10:05,00:23:12:03,"E-mails, credit cards, texts."
00:23:12:07,00:23:15:05,Anything that goes into the record speaks directly to the future.
00:23:16:03,00:23:19:11,"The question is, can the future speak back?"
00:23:20:05,00:23:21:16,And I'm supposed to find out?
00:23:22:16,00:23:25:23,To get anywhere near sator would take a fresh-faced protagonist.
00:23:26:18,00:23:28:23,And you are fresh as a Daisy.
00:23:29:10,00:23:30:10,Get close.
00:23:30:14,00:23:32:23,Find out what he's receiving and how.
00:23:33:03,00:23:34:24,Is it safe to involve British intelligence?
00:23:35:04,00:23:37:17,I have a contact who's out of sator's reach.
00:23:43:23,00:23:45:19,You must've had a plan for getting out.
00:23:46:17,00:23:48:12,Not one I love.
00:24:11:17,00:24:13:02,"May I help you, sir?"
00:24:13:15,00:24:14:21,I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.
00:24:15:01,00:24:17:19,I presume you mean sir Michael Crosby's lunch.
00:24:17:23,00:24:19:01,Presume away.
00:24:19:05,00:24:20:16,If you'll follow me.
00:24:25:09,00:24:27:14,Started without you. Hope you don't mind.
00:24:28:09,00:24:29:14,I'll catch up.
00:24:30:14,00:24:31:16,"Same for me, please."
00:24:31:20,00:24:33:01,I'll send the waiter.
00:24:33:01,00:24:34:16,"No, just pass on the order."
00:24:35:15,00:24:38:08,I gather you have an interest in a certain Russian national.
00:24:38:12,00:24:41:03,Anglo-Russian. So I have to watch my step.
00:24:41:13,00:24:44:03,Indeed. He's tapped into the intelligence services.
00:24:44:08,00:24:46:16,I've warned them he's feeding them rubbish...
00:24:47:12,00:24:48:17,But they don't seem to care.
00:24:48:22,00:24:49:24,Tell me about him.
00:24:50:04,00:24:53:16,I assume you're familiar with the Soviet-era secret cities.
00:24:54:11,00:24:58:06,"Closed cities, not shown on maps. Built around sensitive industries."
00:24:58:10,00:25:01:12,Most of them have been opened up and renamed as regular towns.
00:25:01:16,00:25:03:08,Not the one sator grew up in.
00:25:03:12,00:25:04:14,Stalsk-12.
00:25:05:02,00:25:07:22,"In the ""70s, it had a population of about 200,000."
00:25:08:02,00:25:09:03,Thought to be abandoned.
00:25:09:08,00:25:10:04,Abandoned?
00:25:10:08,00:25:14:17,Some kind of accident. After which it was used for underground tests.
00:25:14:21,00:25:17:11,"Two weeks ago, same day as the Kiev opera siege,"
00:25:17:15,00:25:20:16,"we spotted a detonation in northern Siberia,"
00:25:20:20,00:25:22:21,just where stalsk-12 was.
00:25:23:09,00:25:26:12,Sator emerged from this blank spot on the map
00:25:26:18,00:25:28:17,with ambition...
00:25:28:21,00:25:31:17,And enough money to buy his way into the British establishment.
00:25:31:22,00:25:32:18,Through his wife?
00:25:32:22,00:25:35:23,Katherine barton. Oldest niece of sir Frederick barton.
00:25:36:03,00:25:38:07,She works at shipley's. Met sator at an auction.
00:25:38:11,00:25:39:11,A happy marriage?
00:25:39:12,00:25:40:23,Practically estranged.
00:25:41:17,00:25:42:20,"Well, how do I get to sator?"
00:25:42:22,00:25:44:06,"Well, through her, of course."
00:25:44:10,00:25:46:22,You may have an inflated idea of my powers of seduction.
00:25:47:14,00:25:48:14,Hardly.
00:25:49:16,00:25:51:16,We have an Ace in the hole.
00:25:54:13,00:25:56:23,You're carrying a goya in a harrods bag.
00:25:57:03,00:25:59:02,It's a fake by a spaniard named arepo.
00:26:00:00,00:26:02:19,One of two we've confiscated from an embezzler in Bern.
00:26:03:04,00:26:04:10,What happened to the other one?
00:26:04:14,00:26:07:11,It turned up at shipley's. Authenticated by Katherine barton.
00:26:07:16,00:26:08:16,Put on auction.
00:26:09:04,00:26:10:15,And who do you think bought it?
00:26:10:20,00:26:11:20,Her husband?
00:26:11:22,00:26:12:23,Mmm-hmm.
00:26:14:11,00:26:16:04,Does she know it's a forgery?
00:26:16:08,00:26:17:13,"Oh, it's hard to say."
00:26:17:17,00:26:21:14,Rumor has it that she and arepo were close.
00:26:21:18,00:26:22:21,Uh-huh.
00:26:23:24,00:26:26:02,"Look, no offense,"
00:26:26:06,00:26:29:16,"but in this world, when someone is claiming to be a billionaire..."
00:26:31:06,00:26:33:09,Brooks brothers won't cut it.
00:26:33:13,00:26:35:02,I'm assuming I'm on a budget.
00:26:35:06,00:26:37:16,"Save the world, then we'll balance the books."
00:26:38:13,00:26:40:03,Can I recommend a tailor?
00:26:40:07,00:26:41:10,I'll manage.
00:26:41:14,00:26:43:20,"You British don't have a monopoly on snobbery, you know."
00:26:44:00,00:26:45:06,"Well, not a monopoly."
00:26:45:10,00:26:47:09,More of a controlling interest.
00:26:48:20,00:26:50:08,Could you box that up for me?
00:26:50:13,00:26:51:13,Certainly not.
00:26:52:22,00:26:54:18,"Goodbye, sir Michael."
00:27:27:11,00:27:28:19,"How can I help, sir?"
00:27:32:06,00:27:35:04,"Sorry, I wasn't notified of any appointments, Mr..."
00:27:35:08,00:27:36:08,Goya.
00:27:37:14,00:27:38:12,Mr. goya.
00:27:38:14,00:27:41:07,No. I'm told you're the person to see about goya.
00:27:43:24,00:27:45:07,That's extraordinary.
00:27:50:12,00:27:51:21,What's it worth?
00:27:53:04,00:27:54:19,Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
00:27:56:09,00:27:59:01,Lots of work to do before any kind of valuation.
00:28:00:14,00:28:04:06,"Provenance, microscopic examination, x-rays."
00:28:04:10,00:28:06:12,But what does your heart tell you?
00:28:10:19,00:28:12:17,"Sir, where did you say you acquired this drawing?"
00:28:13:15,00:28:14:17,Tomas arepo.
00:28:18:15,00:28:21:17,I bought my goya for cents on a dollar from an irate Swiss banker.
00:28:21:21,00:28:24:16,"Traced it back to arepo, then realized I scored a bargain"
00:28:24:20,00:28:27:13,when he told me who paid top dollar for another one of his pictures.
00:28:27:17,00:28:29:21,- Your husband. - Where's your bargain?
00:28:30:01,00:28:31:06,Your drawing's an obvious fake.
00:28:31:07,00:28:32:21,My drawing's a very good fake.
00:28:33:01,00:28:34:11,You know that better than anyone.
00:28:34:15,00:28:35:21,The information's the bargain.
00:28:37:16,00:28:40:02,The information that I helped defraud my own husband?
00:28:40:06,00:28:43:06,"He and I are in related businesses, but he's a very hard man to meet."
00:28:43:10,00:28:44:21,If you and I were to make an arrangement...
00:28:44:21,00:28:46:04,Arrangement?
00:28:46:08,00:28:47:16,You mean blackmail.
00:28:47:20,00:28:49:03,Don't be afraid of the word.
00:28:49:07,00:28:51:07,My husband isn't.
00:28:51:12,00:28:53:03,I'm sorry to tell you he got there first.
00:28:53:08,00:28:55:05,He knows? And he's never done anything about it?
00:28:55:09,00:28:56:11,Why would he?
00:28:56:15,00:28:58:02,He paid $9 million for it.
00:28:58:07,00:29:00:13,Barely cover the cost of the holiday he just forced us on.
00:29:00:16,00:29:02:03,"Where'd you go, Mars?"
00:29:03:11,00:29:06:03,"Vietnam, on our yacht. His yacht."
00:29:07:05,00:29:09:20,"You've got the suit. The shoes, the watch."
00:29:10:18,00:29:12:08,Think you're a little out of your depth.
00:29:13:12,00:29:16:16,"People who've amassed fortunes, like your husband's,"
00:29:16:20,00:29:20:10,generally aren't okay with being cheated out of any of it.
00:29:25:22,00:29:28:06,The drawing is his hold over me.
00:29:32:10,00:29:37:10,He threatened me with police. Prison. The works.
00:29:39:15,00:29:41:11,He controls me.
00:29:41:16,00:29:44:10,My contact with my son. Everything.
00:29:44:14,00:29:47:19,"Leaving would never have been easy, but now it's impossible."
00:29:49:02,00:29:51:02,You can't fight.
00:29:51:18,00:29:53:18,Just beg.
00:29:56:00,00:29:57:15,"In Vietnam, I tried to love him again."
00:29:58:06,00:30:01:10,"Thought if there was love there, he might give me my son back."
00:30:01:14,00:30:05:16,"We sat on that bloody boat watching the sunsets,"
00:30:05:21,00:30:08:02,imitating some earlier time in our lives.
00:30:08:06,00:30:10:10,"He seemed happy, so I asked him."
00:30:11:07,00:30:13:06,And he made me an offer.
00:30:13:10,00:30:16:00,He'd let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.
00:30:19:22,00:30:22:24,I expressed myself. I took Max ashore.
00:30:23:04,00:30:25:04,"He called us, contrite."
00:30:25:22,00:30:27:01,"And when we got back,"
00:30:27:05,00:30:28:22,"I glimpsed some other woman diving off the boat,"
00:30:28:23,00:30:30:09,and he'd vanished.
00:30:33:12,00:30:35:07,I never felt such envy.
00:30:35:11,00:30:36:18,You don't seem the jealous type.
00:30:36:22,00:30:38:10,Of her freedom.
00:30:42:01,00:30:44:19,You know how I dream of just diving off that boat?
00:30:44:23,00:30:46:06,But you share a son.
00:30:47:02,00:30:48:20,That's my life now.
00:30:49:17,00:30:51:12,Did you know the drawing was a fake?
00:30:51:14,00:30:52:14,No.
00:30:52:15,00:30:55:03,"Tomas and I became close, maybe too close."
00:30:55:07,00:30:56:07,I failed.
00:30:56:12,00:30:59:02,"Andrei can't conceive of failure, only betrayal."
00:30:59:07,00:31:00:22,But I didn't betray my husband.
00:31:01:03,00:31:03:12,"Retrospect, maybe I missed my chance."
00:31:03:17,00:31:05:09,And he let arepo walk free.
00:31:05:13,00:31:07:12,"If you'd actually met arepo as you claimed,"
00:31:07:16,00:31:10:04,you'd understand he no longer walks anywhere.
00:31:10:08,00:31:11:11,We spoke on the phone.
00:31:11:15,00:31:13:07,He can't do that either.
00:31:13:22,00:31:15:17,- Where's the drawing? - Why?
00:31:15:21,00:31:17:09,Get me an introduction.
00:31:17:13,00:31:19:06,I'll take the drawing out of the equation.
00:31:19:10,00:31:21:16,"No picture, no prosecution, no more hold over you."
00:31:22:17,00:31:24:16,I might just be your second chance.
00:31:24:20,00:31:26:14,"No, I don't need redemption."
00:31:26:18,00:31:28:02,At betrayal.
00:31:34:04,00:31:35:05,Friends of your husband's?
00:31:36:10,00:31:37:20,You knew this was going to happen?
00:31:38:01,00:31:40:05,"Don't worry, they won't kill you."
00:31:40:10,00:31:43:09,Andrei dislikes tangling with local law enforcement on that level.
00:31:43:14,00:31:45:16,You must've really not liked the look of me.
00:31:45:21,00:31:46:22,The look of you's fine.
00:31:47:02,00:31:50:09,It's best to get to the nasty part before I care one way or the other.
00:31:51:06,00:31:52:18,There's a number in your left coat pocket.
00:31:52:19,00:31:54:02,Don't call from home.
00:31:55:19,00:31:57:10,You won't be taking my call.
00:31:59:09,00:32:01:05,I might surprise you.
00:32:32:03,00:32:34:03,I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.
00:32:37:07,00:32:38:13,Can we get going?
00:32:52:07,00:32:53:09,Please?
00:32:54:02,00:32:55:08,He wants you to see.
00:33:21:12,00:33:23:17,And he gets what he wants.
00:33:30:06,00:33:32:06,"Not always, apparently."
00:33:38:13,00:33:40:02,Anna says we're going to Pompeii
00:33:40:04,00:33:41:00,and see lava.
00:33:41:04,00:33:43:12,We will. We'll go together.
00:33:43:16,00:33:45:07,"I'll be there, too!"
00:34:05:04,00:34:06:15,Told you I'd surprise you.
00:34:08:08,00:34:09:08,He's a cute kid.
00:34:09:13,00:34:10:13,He's everything.
00:34:13:00,00:34:14:15,Where's the drawing?
00:34:14:19,00:34:16:10,Oslo. At the airport.
00:34:16:19,00:34:17:19,The airport?
00:34:18:09,00:34:19:18,Do you know what a freeport is?
00:34:21:01,00:34:23:07,A storage facility for art that was acquired...
00:34:23:07,00:34:24:14,But not yet taxed.
00:34:25:13,00:34:27:06,We started a network
00:34:27:22,00:34:31:04,"rotas, this construction company, built them. I brought in the clients."
00:34:31:09,00:34:33:05,The facilities are tax havens.
00:34:33:08,00:34:35:23,"The clients can view their investments without importing them,"
00:34:35:24,00:34:37:24,so they avoid paying tax.
00:34:38:10,00:34:40:19,It's sorta like a transit lounge for art?
00:34:40:23,00:34:42:02,"Art, antiquities."
00:34:42:06,00:34:44:09,#NAME?
00:34:44:12,00:34:46:03,Anything legal.
00:34:46:07,00:34:48:01,But it's not unlike the Swiss banking system.
00:34:48:08,00:34:49:13,Opaque.
00:34:51:08,00:34:54:19,"As I'm sure you are aware, most freeports are just warehouses."
00:34:54:23,00:34:57:15,But here we ensure that you can actually enjoy...
00:34:57:19,00:35:00:04,Rotas has assets in the Oslo freeport. I'm guessing it's there.
00:35:00:04,00:35:02:04,And this way to the vaults!
00:35:02:08,00:35:04:02,#NAME?
00:35:04:06,00:35:06:10,"We make trips there four, five times a year."
00:35:06:14,00:35:08:05,To view art? And whatever it is he does.
00:35:09:06,00:35:11:05,Turns out art's of no importance to andrei.
00:35:11:15,00:35:13:04,But the freeports are.
00:35:14:20,00:35:16:22,The structure of the vaults is based on the Pentagon.
00:35:17:03,00:35:19:20,Each vault a separate structure within the others.
00:35:19:24,00:35:22:16,Damage to one structure won't compromise the others.
00:35:34:04,00:35:38:08,"Some of our clients opt for biometric access, straight in..."
00:35:39:20,00:35:41:07,Off the tarmac.
00:35:41:11,00:35:42:13,From the terminal?
00:35:43:14,00:35:45:11,From their private planes.
00:35:45:15,00:35:46:16,Of course.
00:35:47:19,00:35:50:10,Our logistics department ships to and from
00:35:50:13,00:35:51:18,any other freeport in the world
00:35:51:19,00:35:53:07,without customs inspection.
00:35:53:22,00:35:55:15,What are you hoping to find in there?
00:35:55:19,00:35:56:21,You really wanna know?
00:35:56:23,00:35:58:18,I'm not sure.
00:35:58:22,00:36:00:20,Bring some lead-lined gloves.
00:36:01:05,00:36:02:05,Jesus.
00:36:02:19,00:36:03:23,It's nuclear.
00:36:04:03,00:36:06:03,"When you're on the tour,"
00:36:06:07,00:36:08:06,pay attention to the fire precautions.
00:36:09:21,00:36:11:00,Documents are vulnerable to...
00:36:11:01,00:36:12:09,Fire? Absolutely!
00:36:12:13,00:36:14:22,"No, I was going to say water damage from the sprinkler systems."
00:36:14:22,00:36:16:23,We don't use sprinklers.
00:36:17:03,00:36:19:18,"The facility is flooded with halide gas,"
00:36:19:22,00:36:21:21,displacing all the air within seconds.
00:36:23:05,00:36:24:05,Can you show me?
00:36:24:09,00:36:26:11,"If I did, we'd suffocate."
00:36:27:16,00:36:28:20,What about the staff?
00:36:29:00,00:36:30:13,"Halide only fills the vaults,"
00:36:30:16,00:36:32:09,"they just have to get into either corridor,"
00:36:32:13,00:36:34:10,and there is a ten-second warning.
00:36:34:15,00:36:36:03,At least you give them ten seconds.
00:36:36:06,00:36:41:07,"Well, sir, our clients use us because we have no priorities"
00:36:41:11,00:36:42:18,above their property.
00:36:43:03,00:36:43:23,Blimey.
00:36:44:01,00:36:45:13,All doors are fireproof.
00:36:45:17,00:36:48:11,"Hydraulic closers, simple key and electronic triggers."
00:36:48:15,00:36:50:08,Surprisingly easy once there's a lockdown.
00:36:50:12,00:36:51:19,Why a lockdown?
00:36:51:23,00:36:54:17,"Power switches to fail-safes, sealing the outer doors,"
00:36:54:21,00:36:57:11,but inner doors revert to factory settings.
00:36:58:13,00:36:59:17,And pickable locks.
00:36:59:19,00:37:01:04,"- Hmm. - It's child's play, really."
00:37:01:04,00:37:02:04,Child's play?
00:37:02:08,00:37:03:15,They're inside airport security.
00:37:03:19,00:37:06:17,"They have to worry about climate control, not armed raids."
00:37:06:21,00:37:09:13,"So, how do we get enough firepower through the perimeter"
00:37:09:17,00:37:11:07,to trigger the lockdown procedure?
00:37:13:03,00:37:14:15,Back wall of the freeport.
00:37:14:20,00:37:15:22,You've got something?
00:37:16:21,00:37:18:08,Not gonna like it.
00:37:19:04,00:37:20:24,You wanna crash a plane?
00:37:21:04,00:37:23:10,"Well, not from the air. Don't be so dramatic."
00:37:23:14,00:37:26:05,I want to run a jet off the taxiway
00:37:26:07,00:37:28:14,and breach the rear wall and start a fire.
00:37:30:12,00:37:32:02,"Well, how big a plane?"
00:37:32:20,00:37:36:16,"Well, that part is a little dramatic."
00:37:37:11,00:37:39:14,This is mahir.
00:37:39:18,00:37:40:20,His team'll work the plane.
00:37:40:23,00:37:42:02,There can't be passengers.
00:37:42:06,00:37:43:19,Norsk freight.
00:37:43:23,00:37:46:05,They use the hangar on the West Side of the freeport.
00:37:46:09,00:37:48:15,You want to crash a transport plane? What about the crew?
00:37:48:17,00:37:50:06,"We pop the slides, Chuck 'em off."
00:37:50:10,00:37:51:16,On the move?
00:37:51:20,00:37:53:08,What's the problem? They'll be fine.
00:37:54:11,00:37:56:02,"Well, it seems bold."
00:37:56:07,00:37:59:00,Bold I'm fine with. I thought you were gonna say nuts.
00:37:59:03,00:38:00:06,And if you get caught?
00:38:00:07,00:38:01:07,We won't.
00:38:01:08,00:38:02:15,And if you do?
00:38:03:09,00:38:05:13,"Everyone assumes terrorism, but no one's died,"
00:38:05:15,00:38:08:13,so swift extradition then lost in the system.
00:38:08:17,00:38:10:11,It'll barely make the news.
00:38:10:13,00:38:12:21,"Oh, depends on the size of your explosion."
00:38:13:01,00:38:15:06,"Well, actually, the gold bars might get some play."
00:38:15:10,00:38:16:13,Gold bars?
00:38:16:17,00:38:18:19,Norsk freight ships treasury gold once a month.
00:38:18:23,00:38:21:08,Blow the back. Drop it out on the runway.
00:38:22:12,00:38:25:21,No one will be looking at the building. I guarantee you.
00:38:28:23,00:38:31:04,The space in the center of the Pentagon is too big.
00:38:31:04,00:38:32:10,There's something there.
00:38:33:03,00:38:35:09,"Can't figure it out, it's just not marked."
00:38:37:10,00:38:38:14,That's 45 seconds.
00:38:38:19,00:38:39:21,Ample.
00:38:39:23,00:38:41:04,Won't you be running?
00:38:42:23,00:38:44:07,"All right, it's your turn."
00:38:44:08,00:38:45:16,Start packing.
00:39:02:12,00:39:04:21,"Gentlemen, if you would, through the detector, please."
00:39:08:20,00:39:09:20,Sir?
00:39:10:01,00:39:11:04,Oh.
00:39:11:14,00:39:12:14,"And, sir."
00:39:21:09,00:39:23:15,"I can offer you, perhaps, a coffee, water?"
00:39:23:20,00:39:25:10,"No, I'll take an Espresso."
00:39:25:12,00:39:27:04,#NAME?
00:39:27:08,00:39:28:21,Excellent.
00:39:37:21,00:39:39:16,Is everybody on this plane vegetarian?
00:39:39:20,00:39:41:20,Because all I got here is vegetarian.
00:39:43:21,00:39:46:06,"So that looks like meat,"
00:39:46:10,00:39:48:24,but I think that looks vegetarian. I think they both look vegetarian.
00:39:49:00,00:39:51:04,"I don't really know. It's confusing, ya know?"
00:39:52:00,00:39:53:00,Okay.
00:40:00:06,00:40:01:12,"This way, gentlemen."
00:40:17:16,00:40:19:17,"Gentlemen, your assigned compartment."
00:40:30:13,00:40:32:14,Carry on. Not the radio.
00:40:39:09,00:40:40:14,Let's go.
00:40:56:17,00:40:58:10,Uh...
00:41:11:00,00:41:12:00,Yoga.
00:41:17:02,00:41:18:23,Let's go! Now!
00:41:49:13,00:41:50:13,"Go, go, go!"
00:42:26:02,00:42:28:06,Right. Um...
00:42:42:15,00:42:44:13,"You said ten seconds, right?"
00:44:05:09,00:44:07:12,There's someone in here with us.
00:44:21:21,00:44:23:22,#NAME?
00:44:52:06,00:44:53:06,Don't touch them!
00:44:54:04,00:44:55:10,The hell happened here?
00:45:01:02,00:45:02:19,It hasn't happened yet.
00:47:22:02,00:47:23:06,Don't kill him!
00:47:24:03,00:47:26:09,We need to know if we've been compromised.
00:47:28:13,00:47:30:13,Why are you here?
00:47:30:17,00:47:32:10,Who are you?
00:47:33:04,00:47:35:05,How'd you know we'd be here?
00:47:50:08,00:47:51:23,We need to go.
00:47:57:03,00:47:59:03,What happened to the other guy?
00:47:59:18,00:48:01:20,Took care of him.
00:48:16:11,00:48:17:24,"Well, I've seen too much."
00:48:18:05,00:48:20:15,"I'm still alive, which must mean you've decided to trust me."
00:48:20:20,00:48:22:12,Or maybe I lost my edge.
00:48:22:17,00:48:24:07,Edge is still intact.
00:48:26:09,00:48:27:23,There's a cold war.
00:48:28:12,00:48:29:12,Nuclear?
00:48:29:20,00:48:31:02,Temporal.
00:48:32:11,00:48:33:11,Time travel?
00:48:33:13,00:48:34:13,No.
00:48:34:22,00:48:37:19,Technology that can invert an object's entropy.
00:48:38:22,00:48:40:12,You mean reverse chronology.
00:48:40:16,00:48:43:04,Like feynman and Wheeler's notion that a positron is an electron
00:48:43:04,00:48:44:06,moving backwards in time?
00:48:44:10,00:48:46:02,"Sure, that's exactly what I meant."
00:48:46:06,00:48:47:16,I have a master's in physics.
00:48:47:20,00:48:49:04,"Well, try and keep up."
00:48:49:08,00:48:50:19,The implications of this are...
00:48:50:23,00:48:51:23,Beyond secret.
00:48:52:02,00:48:53:04,Then why'd you bring me in?
00:48:53:07,00:48:56:03,I thought we'd find a drawing and a couple boxes of bullets.
00:48:56:07,00:48:57:22,Not as surprised as I was.
00:48:58:02,00:49:00:23,I'm going back to Mumbai to get some answers.
00:49:01:24,00:49:05:03,"I'll set you up as a go-between. But remember, to you..."
00:49:06:08,00:49:08:18,It's all about plutonium.
00:49:08:22,00:49:10:09,"And when we're done, they'll kill you."
00:49:10:10,00:49:12:16,Won't you have to do that anyway?
00:49:13:08,00:49:14:23,I'd rather it be my decision.
00:49:15:03,00:49:16:03,So would I.
00:49:16:20,00:49:17:20,I think.
00:49:29:23,00:49:30:23,Your work?
00:49:35:08,00:49:38:06,Two antagonists. One inverted.
00:49:38:10,00:49:42:03,"We took out the regular one, but the inverted one got away."
00:49:42:08,00:49:43:15,Both emerged at the same moment?
00:49:43:20,00:49:44:20,Yeanh.
00:49:45:13,00:49:46:15,They were the same person.
00:49:48:06,00:49:50:02,Sator's built a turnstile in that vault.
00:49:50:06,00:49:51:11,Turnstile?
00:49:51:15,00:49:54:01,A machine for inverting.
00:49:54:05,00:49:56:20,You've told me that technology hasn't been invented yet.
00:49:56:24,00:49:57:24,It hasn't.
00:49:58:01,00:49:59:09,He's been given it by the future.
00:49:59:12,00:50:00:22,For what?
00:50:01:08,00:50:03:03,You have the best chance of finding out.
00:50:04:16,00:50:06:12,- Have you met him? - / was close.
00:50:06:13,00:50:08:21,What if you have something he needs?
00:50:09:01,00:50:10:10,Such as?
00:50:10:14,00:50:12:17,Plutonium-241.
00:50:12:21,00:50:15:22,Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under a CIA team
00:50:16:02,00:50:18:11,at the opera siege in Kiev.
00:50:18:15,00:50:20:00,He got the team.
00:50:20:04,00:50:21:05,Not the 241.
00:50:21:09,00:50:22:05,Who did?
00:50:22:09,00:50:24:13,Ukrainian security services.
00:50:24:18,00:50:27:00,It's moving to Tallinn in a week.
00:50:27:05,00:50:29:22,Helping an arms dealer steal weapons-grade plutonium
00:50:30:03,00:50:32:02,"is unacceptable, priya."
00:50:32:19,00:50:34:02,I'm just gonna take him out.
00:50:34:06,00:50:36:12,"No, no, no. Sator has to stay alive."
00:50:36:16,00:50:39:07,He has to stay alive until we know his part in things.
00:50:39:11,00:50:40:21,"Leverage the situation,"
00:50:41:01,00:50:43:01,without losing control of the 241.
00:50:43:05,00:50:44:16,It's too dangerous.
00:50:44:20,00:50:47:03,"A terrorist's bomb, even one that can kill billions,"
00:50:47:07,00:50:49:22,is nothing compared with what will happen if we don't stop sator.
00:50:50:02,00:50:51:16,From doing what?
00:50:51:20,00:50:55:11,We are being attacked by the future.
00:50:56:22,00:50:59:18,And sator's helping. You have to find out how.
00:51:15:19,00:51:18:02,I saw the news from Oslo. Do you have the drawing?
00:51:18:06,00:51:19:22,You don't have to worry about it anymore.
00:51:20:02,00:51:21:17,You destroyed it?
00:51:22:07,00:51:24:02,I didn't think you'd want it back.
00:51:24:06,00:51:25:06,Does he know?
00:51:25:09,00:51:26:19,Not yet. So sit tight.
00:51:26:23,00:51:27:24,Sit tight?
00:51:28:04,00:51:30:22,"Every day my son spends with that monster, he thinks a little less of me."
00:51:30:22,00:51:32:00,It won't be long.
00:51:32:03,00:51:34:16,"In the meantime, introduce me."
00:51:35:07,00:51:36:07,As what?
00:51:36:09,00:51:39:01,I'm a former first secretary from the American embassy in Riyadh.
00:51:39:06,00:51:40:23,We met at a party last June.
00:51:41:01,00:51:42:21,"We were at a party in Riyadh, but I don't think it was in June."
00:51:42:21,00:51:45:05,It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.
00:51:45:09,00:51:48:01,Salmon was on the printed menu. Swapped for sea bass on the night.
00:51:48:06,00:51:49:22,Sator left early. That's when we met.
00:51:50:03,00:51:51:12,I came into shipley's in London.
00:51:51:17,00:51:53:04,You ran into me here
00:51:53:09,00:51:54:23,and wanna show me your yacht.
00:51:55:03,00:51:56:20,He'll think we're having an affair.
00:51:57:10,00:51:58:10,Then he'll wanna meet me.
00:51:58:14,00:51:59:14,Or have you killed.
00:51:59:17,00:52:01:20,Let me worry about that.
00:52:02:03,00:52:03:15,Did I look worried?
00:52:05:08,00:52:06:14,Sleeps 70 with crew.
00:52:06:18,00:52:09:06,Two helicopters. Missile defenses.
00:52:09:10,00:52:10:18,Afraid of pirates?
00:52:10:22,00:52:13:10,Andrel lives playing one government off the other.
00:52:13:14,00:52:15:02,"The day they turn, that's his refuge."
00:52:15:09,00:52:16:09,May I join you?
00:52:16:13,00:52:19:03,Not sure volkov's taking passengers just now.
00:52:19:07,00:52:20:23,Then we'll take mine.
00:52:54:22,00:52:55:22,Max!
00:52:57:15,00:52:59:15,Who's the American?
00:53:01:00,00:53:02:00,He's a friend.
00:53:02:13,00:53:04:08,The man from shipley's.
00:53:05:10,00:53:07:16,Who you tried to have beaten up.
00:53:08:19,00:53:11:04,"I ask again, who is he?"
00:53:13:22,00:53:16:09,We met in Riyadh last June at the American embassy.
00:53:16:14,00:53:18:24,Good with fists for a diplomat.
00:53:19:04,00:53:21:03,"Paranoia's your department, andrei."
00:53:21:08,00:53:24:11,He seems nice. I invited him to the dinner.
00:53:24:15,00:53:25:19,Max?
00:53:25:23,00:53:28:20,He's visiting Pompeii and herculaneum.
00:53:29:04,00:53:30:07,You just sent him off?
00:53:30:22,00:53:33:02,I promised him I'd go with him.
00:53:33:13,00:53:35:13,I explained you were busy.
00:53:37:03,00:53:39:10,With your friend.
00:54:00:14,00:54:02:01,"Hey, easy, fella."
00:54:02:15,00:54:04:20,"Where I'm from, you buy me dinner first."
00:54:15:10,00:54:17:20,- Mr. sator. - Don't bother.
00:54:19:11,00:54:21:17,Just tell me if you've slept with my wife yet.
00:54:22:07,00:54:23:23,Uh... no.
00:54:24:23,00:54:25:23,Not yet.
00:54:27:08,00:54:29:02,How would you like to die?
00:54:29:19,00:54:30:19,Old.
00:54:30:23,00:54:33:09,You chose the wrong profession.
00:54:35:07,00:54:37:02,There's a walled garden up the road.
00:54:37:07,00:54:39:12,"We are going to take you there, cut your throat."
00:54:39:17,00:54:42:15,"Not across. In the middle, like a hole."
00:54:43:01,00:54:45:15,"Then we take your balls and we stuff them in the cut,"
00:54:45:20,00:54:47:07,block the windpipe.
00:54:47:21,00:54:48:21,Complex.
00:54:48:23,00:54:51:20,It's very gratifying to watch a man you don't like
00:54:51:24,00:54:55:20,try to pull his own balls out of his throat before he chokes.
00:54:56:00,00:54:57:12,Is this how you treat all your guests?
00:54:57:15,00:54:59:02,We're finished.
00:55:03:03,00:55:04:03,Do you like opera?
00:55:11:00,00:55:12:02,Well?
00:55:12:06,00:55:13:11,Not here.
00:55:16:24,00:55:17:19,You sail?
00:55:17:24,00:55:19:04,I've messed around on boats.
00:55:19:09,00:55:22:06,Be on the dock at 8:00 ready to do more than mess around.
00:55:22:20,00:55:23:20,8:00 AM
00:55:38:11,00:55:40:17,Max has missed too much school this year.
00:55:40:21,00:55:42:03,I'm taking him back to england.
00:55:42:03,00:55:43:22,The school won't be okay with him missing so much of the term.
00:55:43:22,00:55:45:15,#NAME?
00:55:46:20,00:55:48:18,You have all the trappings of a king.
00:55:48:22,00:55:51:07,We both know you're a grubby little man playing power games
00:55:51:11,00:55:53:06,with a wife who doesn't love you anymore.
00:55:54:12,00:55:55:22,You seem...
00:55:57:01,00:55:58:20,Spirited today.
00:56:00:13,00:56:02:21,#NAME?
00:56:09:04,00:56:11:13,Were you worried it had been destroyed?
00:56:11:17,00:56:14:16,"Rest assured, instinct told me to remove it from the vault."
00:56:15:23,00:56:18:09,I've always had instincts about the future.
00:56:20:03,00:56:23:04,That's how I built this life you no longer value.
00:56:38:08,00:56:40:00,Sailing or diving?
00:56:57:05,00:56:58:14,Rising!
00:57:23:06,00:57:25:11,What do you know about opera?
00:57:25:21,00:57:28:21,"In 2008, a remote Russian missile station"
00:57:29:02,00:57:31:04,was overwhelmed and held for a week.
00:57:31:20,00:57:33:14,"When the station was retaken,"
00:57:33:18,00:57:37:10,241 on one warhead was three quarters of a kilo lighter.
00:57:41:12,00:57:43:12,The missing 241
00:57:43:16,00:57:46:14,surfaced at the opera house siege in Kiev on the 14th.
00:57:46:18,00:57:48:12,Coming about!
00:58:06:14,00:58:08:19,What do you propose?
00:58:09:18,00:58:10:18,Partnership.
00:58:10:20,00:58:12:19,I wouldn't partner with you.
00:58:12:23,00:58:15:23,You can take care of yourself. You have no record.
00:58:17:04,00:58:19:08,"Someone in the arms trade, with training,"
00:58:19:10,00:58:20:24,who knows how to cover his tracks.
00:58:21:04,00:58:22:06,Not that shocking.
00:58:22:10,00:58:24:16,For an intelligence agent.
00:58:24:20,00:58:26:15,Right!
00:58:29:12,00:58:30:18,"Burn in hell, andrei."
00:58:38:07,00:58:40:00,You can't jibe a boat like this!
00:58:40:04,00:58:41:10,You can if you have to.
00:59:09:07,00:59:11:01,- Kat... - Why didn't you let him drown?
00:59:11:05,00:59:12:07,I need him.
00:59:12:22,00:59:13:23,"What, to sell guns?"
00:59:14:03,00:59:15:05,I'm not who you think I am.
00:59:15:07,00:59:16:09,"Well, that I know."
00:59:16:13,00:59:18:05,He showed me the drawing.
00:59:19:06,00:59:21:16,I'm sorry. I had to get close to him.
00:59:21:20,00:59:23:18,I don't know what you think your husband does...
00:59:23:19,00:59:26:07,"Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer."
00:59:26:12,00:59:27:12,He's so much more.
00:59:28:02,00:59:29:02,"What, then?"
00:59:29:05,00:59:32:17,"Andrei sator holds all of our lives in his hands, not just yours."
00:59:41:01,00:59:42:14,Mr. sator wants to see you.
00:59:42:18,00:59:43:18,Okay.
00:59:44:07,00:59:45:07,Now.
00:59:46:10,00:59:48:10,"Uh, he wants to see me without pants?"
00:59:54:12,00:59:56:05,#NAME?
00:59:56:09,00:59:58:11,I'm not falling for it twice.
01:00:00:17,01:00:02:01,You have a better option?
01:00:05:01,01:00:06:22,Whatever it takes to get what you want.
01:00:07:02,01:00:09:14,Not a second's thought for me or my son.
01:00:14:06,01:00:16:08,What do you think he's gonna do to me now?
01:00:27:23,01:00:29:09,Try not to use it.
01:00:31:09,01:00:33:01,On anyone.
01:00:38:12,01:00:39:18,Enough.
01:00:43:12,01:00:46:07,See? Pulse of a man half my age.
01:00:49:14,01:00:51:04,Drink with me.
01:00:53:06,01:00:55:00,It seems I now owe you my life.
01:00:55:15,01:00:56:15,It's nothing.
01:00:56:19,01:00:58:09,My life is not nothing.
01:00:58:22,01:01:01:04,And I don't like to be in debt.
01:01:01:13,01:01:03:08,Then pay me.
01:01:03:12,01:01:05:13,No retribution against your wife.
01:01:08:22,01:01:11:04,You think she released my harness?
01:01:14:15,01:01:16:10,It was my own mistake.
01:01:17:02,01:01:19:00,Then help me steal the 241.
01:01:19:04,01:01:21:10,I need resources. It's weapons-grade plutonium.
01:01:21:14,01:01:23:12,"That means special handling, containment facilities..."
01:01:23:12,01:01:24:22,I know what it means.
01:01:27:06,01:01:30:06,You lecture me about radiation?
01:01:31:06,01:01:33:04,"Andrei sator,"
01:01:33:09,01:01:37:21,digging plutonium from the rubble of my city as a teenager.
01:01:38:02,01:01:39:02,Where?
01:01:41:17,01:01:43:15,Stalsk-12.
01:01:45:03,01:01:46:03,My home.
01:01:49:07,01:01:53:11,"One part of a warhead exploded at ground level, scattering the others."
01:01:59:22,01:02:01:15,It became my first contract.
01:02:01:19,01:02:05:02,Nobody else even bid. They thought it was a death sentence.
01:02:08:03,01:02:09:03,But...
01:02:11:00,01:02:13:17,One man's probability of death...
01:02:15:19,01:02:19:19,1ls another man's possibility for a life.
01:02:22:15,01:02:24:18,I staked my claim in the new Russia.
01:02:25:21,01:02:29:17,"Even now, my company is the only one to operate in the ruins."
01:02:30:17,01:02:33:17,"The 241 is being transported through northern Europe,"
01:02:33:21,01:02:37:23,on its way to the long-term nuclear storage depot in trieste.
01:02:39:05,01:02:41:11,I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.
01:02:46:08,01:02:48:12,Stay with us tonight.
01:02:48:16,01:02:50:07,I insist.
01:03:17:18,01:03:18:20,What do you want?
01:03:19:00,01:03:21:01,We're going to talk about today.
01:03:22:00,01:03:23:00,"No, we're not."
01:03:23:04,01:03:24:04,No?
01:03:26:04,01:03:27:05,We'll see.
01:03:27:18,01:03:29:09,Don't think for a second you can treat me
01:03:29:09,01:03:31:05,like you treat your other women.
01:03:33:07,01:03:35:05,"And, uh..."
01:03:36:08,01:03:38:07,How do you imagine...
01:03:39:07,01:03:40:18,"I treat these other women, huh?"
01:03:40:22,01:03:43:09,You think I force them into conversation?
01:03:43:13,01:03:44:21,"You wanna be quiet, fine."
01:03:45:02,01:03:46:16,You can bite down on that.
01:03:49:17,01:03:53:06,Even a soul as blank and brittle as yours needs a response.
01:03:54:19,01:03:56:20,"Is fear and pain enough, andrei?"
01:03:57:00,01:03:58:06,That's all I have to offer you.
01:03:58:09,01:03:59:21,"Well, that will have to do, then."
01:04:00:01,01:04:02:16,Why didn't you just let me go?
01:04:02:20,01:04:04:20,Because...
01:04:06:20,01:04:11:11,If I can't have you...
01:04:13:01,01:04:15:13,No one else can.
01:04:16:22,01:04:19:16,"And if you touch me, I scream so loud he hears."
01:04:19:20,01:04:21:15,You think I let him interfere?
01:04:21:20,01:04:24:07,"If he tried, you'd have to kill him."
01:04:24:12,01:04:25:12,End of deal.
01:04:27:06,01:04:29:11,So you leave me alone.
01:04:31:04,01:04:32:22,Not now!
01:06:52:21,01:06:56:23,Ninety-eight. Not bad for such exertion.
01:07:07:19,01:07:09:16,He was at the window.
01:07:11:12,01:07:12:17,I was curious.
01:07:14:02,01:07:16:23,My property shouldn't concern you.
01:07:17:03,01:07:18:17,Who are you?
01:07:18:21,01:07:20:23,How do you come by your information about the opera?
01:07:21:03,01:07:25:09,You wouldn't do business with someone who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.
01:07:25:13,01:07:28:20,"Hell, the CIA provides two thirds of the market for fissile material."
01:07:28:23,01:07:31:09,"They're usually buying, not selling."
01:07:32:12,01:07:34:21,But we do live in a twilight world.
01:07:35:06,01:07:36:20,Is that Whitman? Pretty.
01:07:37:00,01:07:38:17,Next warning's a bullet in the brain.
01:07:41:05,01:07:42:09,No balls in my throat?
01:07:43:15,01:07:46:01,There will be no time for such things...
01:07:46:05,01:07:47:05,In Tallinn.
01:07:47:23,01:07:51:13,You make your way there. I want volkov on your team.
01:07:51:18,01:07:52:18,No.
01:07:56:01,01:07:59:13,I spring the material. You pay me off.
01:07:59:17,01:08:01:07,Your wife does the exchange.
01:08:01:11,01:08:02:20,I never involve her in my business.
01:08:02:21,01:08:04:09,"Yeah, that's why I trust her."
01:08:04:24,01:08:06:12,Put him ashore.
01:08:07:00,01:08:08:07,How do I contact you?
01:08:08:08,01:08:09:04,You don't.
01:08:09:08,01:08:10:24,How do you advance me the funds?
01:08:14:21,01:08:17:21,Handle the plutonium better than that.
01:08:28:01,01:08:29:05,What did you find on the gold?
01:08:29:06,01:08:31:05,"No Franks, no mold marks. Nothing."
01:08:31:10,01:08:33:09,#NAME?
01:08:33:22,01:08:36:21,"He buries his time capsule, transmits the location,"
01:08:37:02,01:08:40:02,then digs it up to collect the inverted materials they sent.
01:08:40:15,01:08:43:11,Seemingly instantaneous. Where's he bury it?
01:08:43:15,01:08:46:13,Some place that won't be discovered for centuries.
01:08:46:17,01:08:48:11,What did the soil samples show?
01:08:48:22,01:08:50:24,"Northern Europe, Asia."
01:08:51:04,01:08:52:08,Radioactive.
01:08:52:12,01:08:55:09,Everything salvaged from Oslo's been shipped here.
01:08:56:06,01:08:57:06,Why am I here?
01:08:57:09,01:09:00:14,I don't trust anyone else to assess the pieces.
01:09:01:09,01:09:03:21,"Via convoy through downtown, what's the thinking?"
01:09:04:01,01:09:06:19,Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.
01:09:06:23,01:09:09:01,It's almost impossible to plan an ambush.
01:09:09:05,01:09:10:20,They have a point.
01:09:11:14,01:09:13:01,Is the convoy monitored from the air?
01:09:13:02,01:09:16:17,"Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn, in come the cavalry."
01:09:16:23,01:09:18:04,We need big guns.
01:09:18:07,01:09:20:14,Guns that make the point without being fired.
01:09:20:18,01:09:23:21,We need a fast car that doesn't look fast. Four heavy vehicles.
01:09:24:01,01:09:25:06,All different.
01:09:25:10,01:09:28:07,"Bus, coach, 18-Wheeler. One of them has to be a fire truck."
01:09:29:03,01:09:32:03,"Most of all, we have to set this up with nothing in the record."
01:09:32:08,01:09:34:05,"Nothing electronic, nothing paper."
01:09:34:09,01:09:38:12,I don't want sator ambushing us once we spring the material.
01:09:38:16,01:09:41:07,His ignorance is our only protection.
01:10:18:21,01:10:20:03,"You see, Kat?"
01:10:21:02,01:10:23:08,Some of my favorites.
01:10:24:21,01:10:29:17,"Singed but, uh, salvageable, wouldn't you say?"
01:10:29:21,01:10:32:09,"- That's not my area of expertise. - Ah, that's right."
01:10:32:13,01:10:36:00,You would never have anything to do with such things.
01:10:36:21,01:10:39:08,But this is where our worlds collide.
01:10:39:12,01:10:41:02,"What is this, andrei?"
01:10:41:06,01:10:44:05,"You know perfectly well what it is, Kat."
01:10:47:01,01:10:48:10,The filthy business
01:10:49:03,01:10:52:10,"that put those clothes on your back and our boy in his school,"
01:10:52:14,01:10:54:18,that you thought you could negotiate your way around.
01:11:04:17,01:11:06:00,Time to go.
01:11:06:04,01:11:07:11,I'm not going anywhere with him.
01:11:07:16,01:11:08:16,Ll ook at me!
01:11:10:06,01:11:12:10,"And understand,"
01:11:12:14,01:11:15:03,you don't negotiate with a tiger.
01:11:15:08,01:11:19:07,You admire a tiger until he turns on you
01:11:19:12,01:11:23:11,and you feel its true fucking nature!
01:11:24:05,01:11:25:10,Don't.
01:11:26:12,01:11:28:13,You stay right there.
01:11:32:03,01:11:34:12,Green. Two minutes.
01:11:58:07,01:11:59:10,You are not going to kill me.
01:11:59:12,01:12:01:08,I already tried.
01:12:01:10,01:12:02:12,You pushed me off a boat.
01:12:02:15,01:12:04:14,You are not going to shoot me in cold blood.
01:12:05:01,01:12:07:06,"My blood's not cold, andrei."
01:12:07:11,01:12:10:14,"No, but you're not angry enough."
01:12:12:09,01:12:15:18,Because anger scars over into despair.
01:12:17:20,01:12:20:01,I look in your eyes...
01:12:21:13,01:12:23:04,I see despair.
01:12:27:04,01:12:30:05,Vengeful bitch! Living off me!
01:12:30:09,01:12:31:21,Thinking that you're better!
01:12:32:01,01:12:33:03,Enough!
01:12:57:16,01:13:00:06,Tell me everything as it happens.
01:13:02:15,01:13:04:11,Seal me this side.
01:13:21:20,01:13:24:02,"Yellow, 60 seconds."
01:13:24:07,01:13:25:19,60. Check.
01:13:40:14,01:13:42:24,"Blue, 45 seconds."
01:13:43:09,01:13:44:24,"Blue, 45, check."
01:14:01:13,01:14:03:22,"Okay, red. Coming to you."
01:14:19:06,01:14:21:21,Watch everything. Give me all the details.
01:15:07:04,01:15:08:11,"All right, everyone set?"
01:15:14:07,01:15:16:07,And five...
01:15:17:04,01:15:18:14,Four...
01:15:19:13,01:15:20:13,Three...
01:15:21:15,01:15:22:15,Two...
01:15:24:19,01:15:25:19,One.
01:15:48:12,01:15:49:13,"Go, yellow!"
01:15:53:06,01:15:54:15,We got a problem!
01:15:54:19,01:15:57:13,"Backup, we need backup! Shit!"
01:18:04:00,01:18:06:00,Check the radio chatter.
01:18:22:22,01:18:25:07,I've seen samples of encapsulation in every weapons class.
01:18:25:08,01:18:26:18,This is not one of them.
01:18:26:22,01:18:28:12,That's what he's after.
01:18:32:06,01:18:33:10,Can't understand this.
01:18:33:14,01:18:34:24,You said you spoke Estonian.
01:18:35:04,01:18:36:14,It's not Estonian.
01:18:36:18,01:18:37:20,It's backwards.
01:18:43:06,01:18:44:12,The hell is that?
01:18:59:20,01:19:01:04,"Go, go, go!"
01:19:47:16,01:19:49:05,Don't give it to him.
01:19:49:18,01:19:50:21,This isn't plutonium.
01:19:51:01,01:19:52:09,"It's worse than that, god damn it!"
01:20:11:01,01:20:12:02,Sorry.
01:20:28:06,01:20:29:06,He's getting away.
01:20:31:06,01:20:32:12,He left her in the car!
01:20:32:13,01:20:34:20,"Go after her, go! Go, go, go!"
01:20:48:07,01:20:49:12,Pull up alongside!
01:21:05:07,01:21:07:15,"Come on, come on. Closer!"
01:21:11:12,01:21:12:24,"Keep it steady, keep it steady!"
01:21:15:03,01:21:16:17,Hurry up!
01:21:18:05,01:21:19:09,Please!
01:21:55:16,01:21:58:06,"All right, sit tight. I'm calling the cavalry."
01:21:59:05,01:22:00:12,What cavalry?
01:23:04:21,01:23:06:22,"If you are not telling the truth, she dies."
01:23:09:16,01:23:11:02,I don't know what you're talkin' about.
01:23:11:03,01:23:13:02,"You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right?"
01:23:15:13,01:23:17:04,"- Who told you that? - Just tell me now,"
01:23:17:05,01:23:18:13,is it really in the BMW?
01:23:19:19,01:23:20:19,I don't know.
01:23:20:20,01:23:22:07,Tell me or I'll shoot her again!
01:23:24:04,01:23:25:04,I eave her alone!
01:23:25:08,01:23:26:17,Kill him!
01:23:26:21,01:23:28:17,I don't have time to negotiate.
01:23:34:08,01:23:35:14,- Listen to me! - Three.
01:23:35:14,01:23:36:14,I can help you.
01:23:36:16,01:23:37:21,- Help me! - Two.
01:23:38:01,01:23:39:01,Please!
01:23:39:04,01:23:40:05,- Don't! - One.
01:23:44:16,01:23:46:07,Next one's a bullet to the head.
01:23:47:21,01:23:49:08,- No! - One.
01:23:49:13,01:23:51:01,Two. Three.
01:23:51:06,01:23:52:09,Okay! Okay.
01:23:53:06,01:23:55:10,The car. The BMW.
01:23:55:14,01:23:56:10,I left it in the bmv.
01:23:56:12,01:23:58:00,We're going to check this is real.
01:24:00:19,01:24:01:19,It's in the glove box!
01:24:02:23,01:24:04:22,Where did you leave it?
01:24:05:18,01:24:07:21,"Car or fire truck, which one?"
01:24:08:01,01:24:10:21,Which vehicle did you leave it in? I need to know before I go out there.
01:24:12:17,01:24:13:17,I believe you.
01:24:14:09,01:24:16:09,"You wanted her here, I hope you'll be happy..."
01:24:28:19,01:24:29:22,Clear!
01:24:30:11,01:24:32:01,"Wheeler, go check the other side."
01:24:32:04,01:24:33:09,You two.
01:24:33:14,01:24:34:16,Where did he go?
01:24:34:18,01:24:35:18,The past.
01:24:58:22,01:25:00:09,It's in the glove box!
01:25:00:11,01:25:02:19,We're going to check this is real.
01:25:05:22,01:25:08:11,#NAME?
01:25:08:15,01:25:10:05,Next one's a bullet to the head.
01:25:11:15,01:25:13:20,- No! No! - One.
01:25:14:01,01:25:15:12,#NAME?
01:25:15:19,01:25:16:19,Three.
01:25:16:24,01:25:18:16,I can help you.
01:25:18:20,01:25:20:01,I don't have time to negotiate.
01:25:20:23,01:25:22:05,Tell me or I'll shoot her again.
01:25:23:18,01:25:25:02,"- Leave her alone! - Tell me now,"
01:25:25:03,01:25:26:07,is it really in the BMW?
01:25:26:12,01:25:27:14,I don't know.
01:25:27:19,01:25:29:18,"You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right?"
01:25:30:13,01:25:31:20,Who told you that?
01:25:32:08,01:25:34:06,"If you're not telling the truth, she dies."
01:25:34:10,01:25:36:12,I don't know what you're talking about.
01:25:48:13,01:25:50:00,- Medic! - Check in.
01:25:51:08,01:25:52:22,She's been shot?
01:25:53:07,01:25:54:20,"Bring her back, this side."
01:25:56:10,01:25:58:00,Was she shot with an inverted round?
01:26:03:13,01:26:05:12,This is ives. He's one of us.
01:26:07:02,01:26:08:23,"""Us""! Who are these guys?"
01:26:09:03,01:26:11:05,Priya's. Ours.
01:26:11:09,01:26:12:21,How did sator know about the ambush?
01:26:13:01,01:26:14:09,It's posterity.
01:26:14:13,01:26:16:24,An ambush in the middle of the street can't stay out of the records.
01:26:17:00,01:26:19:23,Bullshit! He knew every move we made! Every one of 'em.
01:26:20:03,01:26:21:08,Somebody talked. Who was it?
01:26:21:12,01:26:22:18,#NAME?
01:26:23:14,01:26:25:14,"At every stage, you've known too much."
01:26:25:18,01:26:28:11,I'm going to ask you again.
01:26:29:09,01:26:31:09,Did you talk?
01:26:33:02,01:26:34:14,Nobody talked.
01:26:34:19,01:26:37:01,They're running a temporal pincer movement.
01:26:37:18,01:26:38:20,A what?
01:26:39:01,01:26:42:14,"The pincer movement. But not in space, in time."
01:26:43:16,01:26:45:15,Half his team moves forward through the event.
01:26:45:19,01:26:48:18,"He monitors them, and then attacks at the end moving backwards,"
01:26:48:22,01:26:50:07,knowing everything.
01:26:50:11,01:26:52:01,Except for where I stashed the plutonium.
01:26:52:14,01:26:54:08,"Which isn't really plutonium, is it?"
01:26:54:10,01:26:55:20,I told you it was what he was after.
01:26:55:21,01:26:58:06,And you just told him where it was.
01:26:59:04,01:27:00:13,I lied.
01:27:01:14,01:27:04:12,Jesus. You lied about it?
01:27:04:16,01:27:07:22,He couldn't verify inside the room. He'd have shot her anyway.
01:27:09:00,01:27:11:07,Lying is standard operating procedure.
01:27:11:11,01:27:12:15,It's spread too far.
01:27:12:19,01:27:13:19,Meaning what?
01:27:13:21,01:27:15:03,She's gonna die.
01:27:15:08,01:27:16:20,Standard operating procedure.
01:27:17:01,01:27:18:21,Can't you help her? Can we do something?
01:27:19:02,01:27:21:17,Can't we stabilize the inverse radiation by inverting the patient?
01:27:21:22,01:27:22:18,Takes days.
01:27:22:22,01:27:24:02,Let's go.
01:27:24:06,01:27:27:05,"We took control of this machine minutes ago. Before that, it's sator's."
01:27:27:09,01:27:29:10,How long is she gonna live on this side?
01:27:29:14,01:27:31:02,"Three hours, tops."
01:27:31:06,01:27:32:18,I'm taking her through.
01:27:32:22,01:27:34:24,I'm not gonna let her die. I'll take my chances.
01:27:35:04,01:27:37:03,There's no way of bringing you back.
01:27:37:19,01:27:38:21,We find another machine.
01:27:39:01,01:27:40:11,A week ago? Where?
01:27:42:13,01:27:44:01,Oslo.
01:27:44:05,01:27:46:15,That facility's inside an airport security perimeter.
01:27:46:19,01:27:47:22,It's impregnable.
01:27:48:14,01:27:50:10,Mmm... it wasn't last week.
01:27:50:18,01:27:52:02,We're going in.
01:27:52:06,01:27:53:07,You might as well help us.
01:27:54:19,01:27:55:23,This is a proving window.
01:27:56:04,01:27:57:10,"As you approach the turnstile,"
01:27:57:15,01:27:59:07,"if you don't see yourself in the proving window,"
01:27:59:08,01:28:00:08,do not enter the machine.
01:28:00:13,01:28:01:09,Why not?
01:28:01:13,01:28:03:08,"If you don't see yourself reverse-exit a machine,"
01:28:03:09,01:28:04:10,then you ain't getting out.
01:28:04:11,01:28:06:10,#NAME?
01:28:07:02,01:28:08:10,See for yourself.
01:28:09:02,01:28:10:22,There's your answer. Let's go.
01:28:35:16,01:28:36:23,She's stabilizing slowly.
01:28:36:23,01:28:38:16,"I'll clean and close, but the rest is time."
01:28:38:20,01:28:40:02,How long does she need?
01:28:40:07,01:28:42:13,"Four, five days. A week to be sure."
01:28:43:20,01:28:45:09,"Hey, Neil. Find a way to get us to Oslo."
01:28:45:10,01:28:46:10,I'm going back out there.
01:28:48:14,01:28:49:16,To do what?
01:28:49:21,01:28:52:13,To stop sator from getting away with whatever it is I just gave him.
01:28:52:14,01:28:54:15,You didn't. You lied about where it was.
01:28:54:19,01:28:55:19,Wait.
01:28:56:12,01:28:57:19,You're going out there for her.
01:28:57:23,01:28:59:11,He threatened to kill her in the past.
01:28:59:15,01:29:01:03,"If he does, what happens to her here?"
01:29:02:18,01:29:04:15,That's unknowable.
01:29:04:17,01:29:07:01,"If you're there to make a change, you're not here to observe its effect."
01:29:07:01,01:29:08:08,What do you believe?
01:29:08:12,01:29:10:15,What's happened's happened.
01:29:10:19,01:29:13:14,"We need to save her, here and now."
01:29:13:18,01:29:16:17,"If you go back out there, you might hand him exactly what he's after."
01:29:17:11,01:29:19:06,Don't let them take her back through there.
01:29:19:15,01:29:20:11,Okay?
01:29:20:14,01:29:22:03,We can't stay here.
01:29:23:07,01:29:24:18,We don't have a lot of time.
01:29:24:22,01:29:27:24,"So why don't you find us a nice, cozy shipping container"
01:29:28:04,01:29:30:06,that's just come off a ship from Oslo?
01:29:30:10,01:29:31:20,This is cowboy shit.
01:29:31:22,01:29:33:11,You have no idea what you're getting yourself into
01:29:33:12,01:29:34:15,if you go through that door.
01:29:34:18,01:29:36:15,"Well, I'm going, so any tips would be welcome."
01:29:36:19,01:29:38:01,"Wheeler, brief him."
01:29:38:15,01:29:40:02,You'll need your own air.
01:29:40:06,01:29:43:10,Regular air won't pass through the membranes of inverted lungs.
01:29:43:14,01:29:44:17,Number one rule:
01:29:44:21,01:29:47:09,Don't come into contact with your forward self.
01:29:47:13,01:29:50:01,It's the whole point of these barriers and protective suits.
01:29:50:05,01:29:51:15,We don't have time.
01:29:51:19,01:29:53:20,"Well, if your particles come into contact..."
01:29:54:00,01:29:55:00,What?
01:29:55:02,01:29:56:02,Annihilation.
01:29:56:05,01:29:58:02,"That would be bad, right?"
01:29:58:06,01:30:01:23,"When you exit the air lock, take a moment to orient yourself."
01:30:02:04,01:30:03:10,Things will feel strange.
01:30:04:15,01:30:06:15,"When you run, the wind will be at your back."
01:30:06:18,01:30:09:20,"You encounter fire, ice will form on your clothes"
01:30:09:23,01:30:11:15,as the transfer of heat is reversed.
01:30:11:19,01:30:15:18,Gravity will feel normal but appear reversed for the world around you.
01:30:16:20,01:30:19:06,You may experience distortions in your vision and hearing.
01:30:19:10,01:30:20:16,This is normal.
01:30:20:20,01:30:22:12,#NAME?
01:30:22:16,01:30:24:06,I can't vouch for the handling.
01:30:24:07,01:30:25:23,Friction and wind resistance are reversed.
01:30:26:15,01:30:28:17,You are inverted. The world is not.
01:30:28:21,01:30:30:12,Was the transponder on the case?
01:30:30:16,01:30:32:08,We've tossed that case.
01:30:32:12,01:30:34:23,I'm moving backwards. It's the ball I have to follow.
01:30:35:03,01:30:36:19,Give me the reader.
01:30:40:21,01:30:42:03,Okay.
01:30:43:05,01:30:44:11,You ready?
01:33:36:08,01:33:38:16,The material's not in the case.
01:33:39:15,01:33:42:07,Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter.
01:33:43:03,01:33:44:14,He was lying.
01:33:44:18,01:33:46:11,It wasn't in the BMW.
01:33:46:15,01:33:47:15,"So, where is it?"
01:34:33:21,01:34:35:19,I saw the handoff.
01:34:35:23,01:34:38:10,You made me shoot her for nothing.
01:34:39:08,01:34:43:03,"You did get my pulse above 130, no one's done that before."
01:34:43:07,01:34:44:20,Not even my wife.
01:35:14:10,01:35:16:24,You left ives and his team a hell of a cleanup.
01:35:18:07,01:35:20:07,Heat transfer was reversed.
01:35:21:04,01:35:22:23,You might be the first case of hypothermia
01:35:23:01,01:35:25:05,from a gasoline explosion in history.
01:35:25:07,01:35:27:23,"At this point, nothing surprises."
01:35:29:15,01:35:30:18,We're headed back to Oslo?
01:35:30:22,01:35:32:19,In a rotas shipping container.
01:35:33:04,01:35:34:07,"He's got the material, Nell."
01:35:35:02,01:35:36:22,I handed it to him on a plate.
01:35:37:06,01:35:38:14,I warned you...
01:35:38:18,01:35:39:20,What's happened's happened.
01:35:40:01,01:35:41:13,I get it now.
01:35:41:18,01:35:44:16,But it's hard to take things on trust from people speaking half-truths.
01:35:45:17,01:35:46:13,That's not fair.
01:35:46:17,01:35:48:19,You were a part of this before we met.
01:35:49:13,01:35:50:15,Were you working for priya?
01:35:50:18,01:35:51:14,No.
01:35:51:18,01:35:52:24,"Who recruited you, Neil?"
01:35:53:18,01:35:56:16,It can't possibly do you any good to know that right now.
01:35:56:20,01:36:01:16,"When this is over, if we're still standing, and you still care,"
01:36:01:20,01:36:04:11,"then you can hear my life story, okay?"
01:36:06:19,01:36:08:11,I'm sorry I involved you.
01:36:08:15,01:36:10:08,You need to tell me what's going on.
01:36:10:12,01:36:13:05,Apparently Neil here knows more about it than I do.
01:36:13:09,01:36:14:09,"Good luck, pal."
01:36:14:13,01:36:17:09,"By telling Kat anything, we're compromising her in priya's eyes."
01:36:17:14,01:36:20:00,"In priya's eyes, she's already compromised."
01:36:20:05,01:36:22:07,She has the right to know why she might die.
01:36:22:12,01:36:23:14,Am I gonna die?
01:36:23:18,01:36:25:08,Not if we have something to say about it.
01:36:25:10,01:36:26:10,And we do.
01:36:26:17,01:36:28:04,Who are you?
01:36:29:08,01:36:32:20,Let's start with the simple stuff. Every law of physics...
01:36:39:02,01:36:41:03,The material's not in the case.
01:36:41:06,01:36:44:10,Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter.
01:36:53:12,01:36:54:13,You injured?
01:37:00:09,01:37:02:08,"What's the algorithm, Neil?"
01:37:04:08,01:37:07:10,2411s one section of it. One out of nine.
01:37:08:22,01:37:11:02,It's a formula rendered into physical form
01:37:11:04,01:37:12:22,so it can't be copied or communicated.
01:37:13:22,01:37:15:15,It's a black box with one function.
01:37:16:09,01:37:17:21,Which is?
01:37:18:18,01:37:21:12,Inversion. But not objects or peoples.
01:37:21:16,01:37:22:18,The world around us.
01:37:22:22,01:37:23:22,I don't understand.
01:37:24:02,01:37:27:05,"As they invert the entropy of more and more objects,"
01:37:27:09,01:37:31:00,the two directions of time are becoming more intertwined.
01:37:31:04,01:37:34:05,But because the environment essentially flows in our direction...
01:37:34:12,01:37:35:12,We dominate.
01:37:35:16,01:37:37:06,They're always swimming upstream.
01:37:37:10,01:37:38:13,It's what saved your life.
01:37:38:17,01:37:41:08,Inverted explosion was pushing against the environment.
01:37:41:17,01:37:42:17,Pissing in the wind.
01:37:42:21,01:37:45:15,And the algorithm can change the direction of that wind.
01:37:45:20,01:37:48:04,It can invert the entropy of the world.
01:37:49:01,01:37:50:03,And if that happens?
01:37:50:11,01:37:51:12,Oh...
01:37:52:05,01:37:53:08,End of play.
01:37:53:20,01:37:55:22,"""End of play.” can you be a little more precise?"
01:37:56:02,01:37:59:13,"Everyone and everything that's ever lived, destroyed. Instantly."
01:37:59:17,01:38:00:17,Precise enough?
01:38:00:21,01:38:02:12,Including my son.
01:38:05:16,01:38:08:18,"The more you sleep, the faster you'll heal."
01:38:24:14,01:38:25:20,On a truck.
01:38:28:05,01:38:29:11,Shouldn't be long now.
01:38:30:20,01:38:32:19,I've been thinking.
01:38:32:24,01:38:34:20,We're their ancestors.
01:38:35:04,01:38:37:13,"If they destroy us, won't that destroy them?"
01:38:38:01,01:38:40:03,This brings us to the grandfather paradox.
01:38:40:07,01:38:41:11,The what?
01:38:42:09,01:38:43:19,If you went back in time
01:38:43:23,01:38:45:06,"and killed your own grandfather,"
01:38:45:08,01:38:47:09,how could you have been born to commit the act?
01:38:47:13,01:38:48:09,What's the answer?
01:38:48:13,01:38:50:03,There's no answer. It's a paradox.
01:38:50:19,01:38:51:19,"But in the future,"
01:38:51:21,01:38:53:17,those in power clearly believe that you can
01:38:53:21,01:38:55:04,"kick grandpa down the stairs,"
01:38:55:08,01:38:56:23,"gouge his eyes out,"
01:38:57:03,01:38:58:07,"slit his throat,"
01:38:58:11,01:38:59:14,without consequence.
01:39:00:04,01:39:01:19,Could they be right?
01:39:01:23,01:39:03:10,Doesn't matter.
01:39:03:14,01:39:05:08,They believe it.
01:39:05:13,01:39:07:12,So they're willing to destroy us.
01:39:09:09,01:39:10:23,Can I go back to sleep now?
01:39:11:03,01:39:12:09,No. I thought of something else.
01:39:12:13,01:39:13:09,Great.
01:39:13:13,01:39:15:16,This reversing the flow of time.
01:39:15:19,01:39:18:11,Doesn't us being here now mean it never happens?
01:39:18:15,01:39:19:16,That we stop them?
01:39:21:01,01:39:22:17,"Optimistically, I'd say that's right."
01:39:23:07,01:39:24:12,Pessimistically?
01:39:24:16,01:39:27:10,"In a parallel worlds theory, we can't know the relationship"
01:39:27:12,01:39:30:12,between consciousness and multiple realities.
01:39:30:16,01:39:31:22,Does your head hurt yet?
01:39:32:02,01:39:33:06,Yes.
01:39:37:04,01:39:38:14,Try to sleep.
01:39:53:16,01:39:54:21,Shit.
01:39:56:07,01:39:58:06,They didn't take us inside.
01:39:59:12,01:40:01:03,What do we do?
01:40:04:12,01:40:05:12,We use the breach.
01:40:05:16,01:40:07:19,The chaos right after impact. Get ready.
01:40:10:18,01:40:12:06,She healed enough?
01:40:13:04,01:40:14:21,I don't know.
01:40:15:01,01:40:16:12,I've never done this before.
01:40:16:14,01:40:19:02,The fire crew's there.
01:40:19:06,01:40:20:13,"You take Kat through the breach,"
01:40:20:18,01:40:22:15,I take care of sator's men and secure the vault.
01:40:22:17,01:40:24:05,Then you bring her in.
01:40:25:18,01:40:26:18,How's your arm?
01:40:26:22,01:40:28:11,Not good.
01:40:33:07,01:40:34:21,We move as soon as we hear the engines.
01:40:39:12,01:40:40:14,"Hold on, hold on. “What?"
01:40:40:19,01:40:41:23,You're bleeding.
01:40:42:17,01:40:44:03,"All right, let me take a look at it."
01:40:50:16,01:40:51:16,Ready?
01:41:24:16,01:41:26:04,Wait here. I'm going in.
01:43:23:16,01:43:24:16,Come on!
01:43:24:23,01:43:25:24,"Go, go, go!"
01:43:56:08,01:43:57:08,Go!
01:45:39:16,01:45:41:07,You knew it was me coming out of that vault.
01:45:41:08,01:45:42:14,Why didn't you say?
01:45:42:18,01:45:43:19,That's a lot of explaining
01:45:43:20,01:45:45:21,when someone's about to put a bullet in their own brain.
01:45:45:21,01:45:46:21,But afterwards?
01:45:47:07,01:45:50:07,"Thing's the same, I knew you'd be okay."
01:45:50:11,01:45:51:15,What's happened's happened.
01:45:52:05,01:45:55:06,"If I told you and you acted differently, who knows?"
01:45:57:00,01:45:59:01,The policy is to suppress.
01:45:59:13,01:46:01:06,Whose policy?
01:46:01:11,01:46:02:14,"Ours, my friend."
01:46:06:07,01:46:09:03,We're the people saving the world from what might've been.
01:46:18:24,01:46:20:02,Kat?
01:46:21:01,01:46:22:07,I'm here.
01:46:23:07,01:46:24:11,It'll be quite a scar.
01:46:24:22,01:46:26:03,You'll be okay.
01:46:28:14,01:46:29:14,Did it.
01:46:30:00,01:46:31:03,You did what?
01:46:31:23,01:46:33:14,Andrei has the algorithm.
01:46:34:18,01:46:36:12,You don't know where he is.
01:46:38:16,01:46:39:21,Or when.
01:46:41:06,01:46:43:13,#NAME?
01:46:43:18,01:46:46:09,"If I don't do something, in two days, she tells me about the 241."
01:46:46:14,01:46:47:17,Nothing can change that.
01:46:48:04,01:46:49:04,We'll see.
01:46:49:23,01:46:51:07,Just get her here.
01:46:53:22,01:46:54:24,"Hello, priya."
01:46:55:23,01:46:57:05,What's going on?
01:46:57:09,01:46:58:19,Where's Neil?
01:46:58:23,01:47:02:11,"Nursing Katherine barton, who almost died because of you."
01:47:02:15,01:47:03:15,What did I do?
01:47:03:16,01:47:04:20,It's what you're going to do.
01:47:04:22,01:47:07:14,"In two days, you're gonna have me dangle plutonium-241"
01:47:07:18,01:47:09:24,in front of the world's most dangerous arms dealer.
01:47:10:04,01:47:11:17,"Now, I wanna know why."
01:47:11:21,01:47:14:00,You let sator get hold of 241?
01:47:14:04,01:47:15:22,"No, I let him get ahold of the algorithm."
01:47:17:13,01:47:19:09,"So, tell me about it, priya."
01:47:20:01,01:47:22:12,It's... it's unique.
01:47:22:16,01:47:24:10,The scientist who built it took her own life
01:47:24:15,01:47:26:05,so she couldn't be forced to make another.
01:47:26:06,01:47:27:06,A scientist in the future?
01:47:27:08,01:47:28:10,Generations from now.
01:47:28:15,01:47:30:00,Why does she have to kill herself?
01:47:33:11,01:47:35:07,"As they approached the first atomic test,"
01:47:35:10,01:47:36:20,Oppenheimer became concerned
01:47:36:24,01:47:39:17,"that the detonation might produce a chain reaction,"
01:47:39:21,01:47:40:22,engulfing the world.
01:47:41:02,01:47:42:21,They went ahead anyway and got lucky.
01:47:42:24,01:47:46:24,Think of our scientist as her generation's Oppenheimer.
01:47:47:14,01:47:49:22,"She devises a method for inverting the world,"
01:47:50:02,01:47:52:16,"but becomes convinced that by destroying us,"
01:47:52:20,01:47:54:07,they're destroying themselves.
01:47:54:11,01:47:56:05,The grandfather paradox.
01:47:56:09,01:47:58:04,"But, unlike Oppenheimer,"
01:47:58:08,01:47:59:14,"she rebels,"
01:47:59:18,01:48:01:20,splitting the algorithm into nine sections
01:48:01:23,01:48:04:09,and hiding them the best place she can think of.
01:48:04:23,01:48:05:23,The past.
01:48:06:04,01:48:07:04,"Here, now."
01:48:07:09,01:48:09:14,There are nine nuclear powers.
01:48:09:18,01:48:10:18,Nine bombs.
01:48:11:06,01:48:14:16,Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials in the history of the world.
01:48:14:20,01:48:16:19,The best hiding place possible.
01:48:16:23,01:48:18:24,Nuclear containment facilities.
01:48:19:19,01:48:21:05,"Sator's lifelong mission,"
01:48:21:09,01:48:23:20,"financed and guided by the future, has been to"
01:48:23:24,01:48:26:05,find and reassemble the algorithm.
01:48:26:09,01:48:27:15,Why do they choose him?
01:48:27:19,01:48:29:17,Because he was at the right place at the right time.
01:48:29:18,01:48:31:22,The collapse of the Soviet union.
01:48:32:02,01:48:35:04,The most insecure moment in the history of nuclear weapons.
01:48:35:08,01:48:37:12,How many sections does he have?
01:48:37:16,01:48:39:06,"After the 241, all nine."
01:48:39:10,01:48:40:22,Jesus Christ.
01:48:41:12,01:48:44:11,And that's why you're going to do things differently this time.
01:48:45:10,01:48:46:20,To change things?
01:48:47:01,01:48:48:06,So Katherine won't get hurt?
01:48:48:11,01:48:50:13,So sator won't get the algorithm.
01:48:52:16,01:48:54:12,If that universe can exist...
01:48:55:05,01:48:56:05,We don't live in it.
01:48:56:09,01:48:57:16,"Well, let's try."
01:48:58:09,01:49:00:02,You're going to warn me.
01:49:00:06,01:49:01:22,"No, I'm not."
01:49:02:02,01:49:03:11,Ignorance is our ammunition.
01:49:03:15,01:49:04:16,Come on.
01:49:04:20,01:49:07:02,"If you had known what the algorithm was,"
01:49:07:06,01:49:09:09,would you have let it fall into sator's hands?
01:49:10:19,01:49:12:16,You want sator to get the last section.
01:49:12:20,01:49:15:08,That is the only way he'll bring together the other eight.
01:49:15:12,01:49:17:04,I was supposed to steal it...
01:49:17:15,01:49:18:17,Then lose it?
01:49:18:21,01:49:20:06,Mission accomplished.
01:49:20:19,01:49:22:05,You used me.
01:49:23:06,01:49:24:14,As you used Katherine.
01:49:25:12,01:49:27:04,Standard operating procedure.
01:49:28:19,01:49:30:01,You've done your part.
01:49:30:19,01:49:31:19,My part?
01:49:32:03,01:49:34:14,I'm the protagonist of this operation.
01:49:34:18,01:49:35:20,You...
01:49:36:01,01:49:37:20,Are a protagonist.
01:49:37:24,01:49:40:20,Did you think you were the only one capable of saving the world?
01:49:45:15,01:49:46:15,No.
01:49:47:24,01:49:49:10,But I am.
01:49:49:14,01:49:50:15,Because I haven't told you
01:49:50:19,01:49:52:17,where he's assembling the algorithm or when.
01:49:52:21,01:49:53:23,You're about to.
01:49:54:03,01:49:55:13,"No, I'm not."
01:49:55:17,01:49:56:19,"So, deal us in."
01:49:58:00,01:49:59:01,"""Us""?"
01:49:59:14,01:50:01:03,Why would you want to involve her again?
01:50:01:03,01:50:02:11,Because she can get close to him.
01:50:02:14,01:50:03:21,Does he still trust her?
01:50:04:01,01:50:05:05,He thinks she's dead.
01:50:05:09,01:50:06:13,But he used to.
01:50:06:17,01:50:09:00,You have started looking at the world in a new way.
01:50:09:04,01:50:10:13,"And now, it's your turn."
01:50:10:17,01:50:12:07,"Assuming she makes it out alive,"
01:50:12:10,01:50:14:08,whether or not you feel she knows too much.
01:50:14:13,01:50:15:09,I can't.
01:50:15:13,01:50:16:17,"If you don't have the authority,"
01:50:16:18,01:50:19:08,then talk to whoever's in charge of loose ends.
01:50:19:13,01:50:21:06,I need your word
01:50:21:11,01:50:23:22,"that she and her son will be safe, priya."
01:50:24:12,01:50:26:13,What good is someone's word in our line of business?
01:50:32:08,01:50:33:08,They'll be safe.
01:50:35:07,01:50:37:09,There's a rally point offshore at trondheim.
01:50:37:13,01:50:39:00,Get yourselves up there.
01:50:39:04,01:50:40:23,Ives has a team ready to invert.
01:50:41:03,01:50:42:13,You have a turnstile?
01:50:42:14,01:50:45:03,The exact technology that we're trying to suppress.
01:50:45:07,01:50:47:10,Fighting fire with fire's a treacherous business.
01:50:48:00,01:50:50:07,"But there are some people, in the future,"
01:50:50:11,01:50:53:14,who want to continue the algorithm's journey into the past.
01:50:54:17,01:50:56:06,You see...
01:50:56:11,01:50:59:05,Tenet wasn't founded in the past.
01:50:59:10,01:51:02:02,It will be founded in the future.
01:51:28:19,01:51:30:15,Can't get over the birds.
01:51:30:19,01:51:32:13,How're you feeling?
01:51:37:22,01:51:39:10,Tell me you're gonna kill him.
01:51:40:05,01:51:41:01,I can't.
01:51:41:05,01:51:42:07,Why not?
01:51:42:11,01:51:44:07,Bet you've probably killed a lot of people.
01:51:44:11,01:51:46:12,Not with a dead man's switch.
01:51:46:16,01:51:48:10,The fitness tracker he wears.
01:51:48:20,01:51:50:03,He's obsessive about his health.
01:51:50:04,01:51:51:11,"It'll be linked to a switch,"
01:51:51:12,01:51:53:15,probably a simple e-mail burst
01:51:53:17,01:51:55:09,"that reveals the location of the dead drop,"
01:51:55:12,01:51:57:08,set to fire if his heart stops.
01:51:57:12,01:51:59:16,His death activates the algorithm.
01:51:59:20,01:52:01:08,"He dies, the world ends."
01:52:01:16,01:52:03:06,No one dares kill him.
01:52:05:15,01:52:07:13,"No, you've missed the point."
01:52:09:21,01:52:11:07,He's intending to end his life.
01:52:13:18,01:52:14:18,Why?
01:52:16:09,01:52:17:19,He's dying.
01:52:22:13,01:52:24:11,And he's taking the world with him.
01:52:24:15,01:52:26:16,"If he can't have her, no one can."
01:52:26:24,01:52:30:16,He gets to choose the time and place for the end of the world.
01:52:31:02,01:52:33:12,What moment? What does he choose?
01:52:35:13,01:52:38:06,You told me about a holiday where you let him feel loved.
01:52:38:18,01:52:39:23,Vietnam.
01:52:40:03,01:52:41:18,You said he vanished. What day?
01:52:41:22,01:52:44:17,"I went ashore with Max and he flew off, but I don't know what day it was."
01:52:44:17,01:52:46:19,It was the 14th. Ten days ago.
01:52:46:23,01:52:47:23,He was in Ukraine.
01:52:48:10,01:52:49:22,At the Kiev opera siege.
01:52:50:02,01:52:52:09,How do you know about that?
01:52:53:18,01:52:56:02,"The point is, he wasn't on his yacht, so that's his window."
01:52:56:03,01:52:58:13,To go back to that golden moment and have it be his last.
01:52:58:18,01:52:59:22,Everyone's last.
01:53:00:06,01:53:02:03,We have to lift the algorithm from the dead drop
01:53:02:04,01:53:03:04,without sator knowing.
01:53:03:07,01:53:05:14,"If he believes it's there, he kills himself."
01:53:05:18,01:53:07:05,And not the rest of us.
01:53:07:09,01:53:08:11,Where's the dead drop?
01:53:08:15,01:53:10:04,"Knowledge divided, my friend."
01:53:10:08,01:53:11:08,You're not gonna tell me?
01:53:11:12,01:53:12:15,Ignorance is our ammunition.
01:53:13:02,01:53:14:16,"But I need you back on that yacht, Kat."
01:53:14:20,01:53:15:21,Why?
01:53:16:02,01:53:19:01,You have to stop him killing himself until we know the algorithm
01:53:19:05,01:53:21:02,is out of the dead drop.
01:53:21:06,01:53:23:06,"But if I'm caught there, my son sees."
01:53:23:10,01:53:25:04,I don't want those moments to be full of anguish
01:53:25:04,01:53:27:04,if they're gonna be his last.
01:53:28:00,01:53:29:02,They're not.
01:53:54:06,01:53:55:06,It's time.
01:53:55:07,01:53:56:24,"We're working our way back to the 14th,"
01:53:57:02,01:53:58:18,"but without knowing where the dead drop is,"
01:53:58:20,01:54:01:01,there's only so much I can do to prepare.
01:54:02:09,01:54:04:05,You know what a hypocenter is?
01:54:05:14,01:54:07:22,It's ground zero for an underground nuclear test.
01:54:08:02,01:54:13:03,Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation in stalsk-12 on the 14th.
01:54:13:07,01:54:15:09,The dead drop is at the bottom of the hypocenter.
01:54:18:15,01:54:20:08,"Well, then we better pull it out of that hole"
01:54:20:08,01:54:22:08,"before the bomb goes off, en?"
01:54:24:19,01:54:26:03,Line it up.
01:54:26:14,01:54:27:14,Move forward.
01:54:29:17,01:54:30:17,Next.
01:54:34:24,01:54:35:24,Line it up.
01:54:37:19,01:54:38:23,Where's Neil?
01:54:42:03,01:54:43:10,He must've gone through already.
01:54:43:12,01:54:44:15,I didn't get to say goodbye.
01:54:45:07,01:54:46:18,"This is goodbye, isn't it?"
01:54:46:22,01:54:48:07,I'd like to say...
01:54:48:19,01:54:50:08,"That you don't have to do this, Kat..."
01:54:50:08,01:54:53:17,Worst thing andrei ever did to me was that offer he made me.
01:54:53:21,01:54:56:21,Let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.
01:54:58:05,01:54:59:23,I shouted and...
01:55:00:07,01:55:01:17,Swore.
01:55:02:12,01:55:04:18,"But he'd seen it on my face, just for an instant."
01:55:08:05,01:55:09:16,I considered it.
01:55:10:13,01:55:12:18,"I don't know if I hate him more for what he's done,"
01:55:12:22,01:55:14:18,or because he knows that about me.
01:55:18:04,01:55:19:18,A chance to help save my child.
01:55:19:20,01:55:21:12,You can't know what that means to a mother.
01:55:21:22,01:55:22:18,No.
01:55:22:22,01:55:24:19,You've killed people you've hated before.
01:55:25:07,01:55:26:14,It's not usually personal.
01:55:26:18,01:55:28:18,"Well, he's dying anyway. Maybe it doesn't even count."
01:55:28:18,01:55:30:09,"It always counts, Kat."
01:55:30:20,01:55:33:12,"You're not there to kill him, you're the backstop."
01:55:34:12,01:55:37:00,"If we don't lift that algorithm and he kills himself,"
01:55:37:04,01:55:38:19,he takes us all with him.
01:55:41:12,01:55:43:14,"You just keep up your end, okay?"
01:55:47:19,01:55:49:00,Today's the 14th.
01:55:49:07,01:55:50:16,Offshore of Siberia.
01:55:50:21,01:55:52:05,Time for us to go.
01:55:52:09,01:55:53:15,"You keep going back another day,"
01:55:53:18,01:55:55:13,give you some time to get back into Vietnam.
01:55:55:17,01:55:56:20,And who gets me on the yacht?
01:55:56:21,01:55:58:04,I've got somebody good lined up.
01:55:58:06,01:56:01:08,"When it's over, when you're raising your boy, carry this."
01:56:01:19,01:56:04:03,There may be a time and place you feel threatened.
01:56:04:07,01:56:06:23,"Hit ""talk,"" state your location, hang up."
01:56:07:10,01:56:09:00,Who gets the message”?
01:56:09:11,01:56:11:02,Posterity.
01:56:50:12,01:56:51:20,Stalsk-12.
01:56:52:00,01:56:55:09,Hidden from the world is a city where anything can happen.
01:56:55:13,01:56:59:17,"And today, ladies and gents, for ten minutes, it most assuredly does."
01:56:59:21,01:57:03:11,You've been divided into two teams for a temporal pincer movement.
01:57:03:15,01:57:04:22,"We're red team, moving forward."
01:57:05:02,01:57:07:14,"In order to distinguish the teams, you'll wear these."
01:57:07:18,01:57:08:22,"Our friends over there,"
01:57:09:03,01:57:11:11,"blue team, led by commander Wheeler, are inverted."
01:57:11:16,01:57:13:09,Why don't they let us see them?
01:57:13:22,01:57:15:06,Maybe we won't like what happened.
01:57:15:10,01:57:18:06,"One hour from now, they had this briefing."
01:57:20:05,01:57:23:11,"Then, were dropped on the Ridge above the hypocenter,"
01:57:23:15,01:57:25:20,as close in time to the detonation as possible.
01:57:25:24,01:57:29:20,Their objectives were clearance and clarification.
01:57:30:00,01:57:33:18,"Now, this briefing has the benefit of their experience."
01:57:50:17,01:57:52:12,Both teams have countdown watches.
01:57:52:17,01:57:55:01,"Ours counts down from ten, from landing"
01:57:55:06,01:57:56:17,to zero to the explosion.
01:57:56:21,01:57:58:19,#NAME?
01:57:58:20,01:58:02:20,"If you are not at the lz at zero, you are not leaving."
01:58:03:22,01:58:05:05,Do you understand?
01:58:05:12,01:58:08:24,"We drop in, clear lzs for blue team evacuation."
01:58:09:04,01:58:10:19,We make our way into the city proper.
01:58:10:22,01:58:13:09,"These buildings are abandoned, but we learned"
01:58:13:13,01:58:15:00,there is a turnstile.
01:58:15:04,01:58:17:02,Expect a bitemporal response.
01:58:17:06,01:58:18:16,They'll have inverse ordnance?
01:58:18:20,01:58:21:02,"Inverse, conventional,"
01:58:21:06,01:58:23:18,"forward antagonists, inverted antagonists, they have it all."
01:58:24:11,01:58:25:21,"On the other side of the city,"
01:58:25:23,01:58:28:10,the ground rises to the Ridge above the hypocenter.
01:58:28:14,01:58:31:19,A splinter unit will take this tunnel from the city
01:58:31:24,01:58:33:19,to the floor of the hypocenter.
01:58:33:24,01:58:36:12,Blue team located an entrance here.
01:58:36:17,01:58:38:17,"The bomb is in this rock,"
01:58:38:22,01:58:41:18,"high above, to trigger a collapse,"
01:58:41:22,01:58:42:23,sealing the cavern.
01:58:43:03,01:58:44:14,How do we defuse the bomb up there?
01:58:44:16,01:58:47:06,We don't. The explosion takes place as planned.
01:58:47:10,01:58:51:06,"Now, our job is to fail to defuse that bomb"
01:58:51:10,01:58:54:19,while the splinter unit achieves its task undetected.
01:58:54:22,01:58:55:22,Which is?
01:58:56:00,01:58:57:03,"Need-to-know, and you don't."
01:58:58:02,01:58:59:18,Any other stupid questions?
01:59:00:03,01:59:02:10,"Good. Well, let's go. Let's get ready."
01:59:05:08,01:59:06:18,I wanted to be on the first wave.
01:59:06:22,01:59:08:07,There 1s no first wave.
01:59:08:11,01:59:10:22,Red team and blue team operate simultaneously.
01:59:11:02,01:59:12:02,"Look,"
01:59:12:04,01:59:14:21,don't get on the chopper if you can't stop thinking in linear terms.
01:59:15:01,01:59:18:10,"Now, you wanna be on the team that lifts the contents of the capsule?"
01:59:18:15,01:59:20:02,Absolutely.
01:59:20:18,01:59:22:04,"Yeah, that's us."
01:59:22:22,01:59:24:04,We're splinter unit.
01:59:24:08,01:59:25:10,Just us?
01:59:26:03,01:59:29:02,No one who knows the contents of that capsule can leave the field.
01:59:29:24,01:59:32:11,I thought we'd manage ourselves.
01:59:42:08,01:59:44:08,It's 40 feet from the private deck to the water.
01:59:44:08,01:59:45:08,Can you jump it?
01:59:45:21,01:59:47:09,I can dive it.
02:00:25:21,02:00:27:06,Thirty seconds!
02:01:08:08,02:01:09:08,Go! Go! Go!
02:01:21:05,02:01:22:23,We're coming in on a shockwave.
02:01:23:04,02:01:24:07,"Hang on, people."
02:01:33:12,02:01:34:19,On your feet!
02:01:48:12,02:01:49:21,There!
02:02:03:03,02:02:04:19,Ma'am. We thought you'd gone ashore.
02:02:04:20,02:02:06:08,"Well, I snuck back to surprise andrei."
02:02:06:11,02:02:07:11,"Oh, the boss left."
02:02:08:23,02:02:11:02,"Well, have Mr. sator find me here."
02:02:11:06,02:02:12:13,And don't tell the others.
02:02:12:17,02:02:13:23,I'll get the mess.
02:03:21:13,02:03:22:13,Mines!
02:03:22:18,02:03:23:18,Mines!
02:03:38:02,02:03:39:15,They told me you'd gone ashore.
02:03:41:17,02:03:42:21,They told me you'd flown off.
02:03:42:24,02:03:45:03,I came back to see you and Max.
02:03:45:07,02:03:47:04,Max is on shore with Anna.
02:03:48:15,02:03:50:09,"We need time, just you and me, after what happened."
02:03:50:09,02:03:52:18,I was joking. It was a stupid joke.
02:03:53:11,02:03:54:22,You think I'm a terrible mother.
02:03:55:02,02:03:58:12,We both know my opinion of you is higher than yours of me.
02:04:06:11,02:04:08:18,"I want things to be better, andrei."
02:04:24:10,02:04:25:14,Take cover!
02:04:29:23,02:04:31:18,Get me a goddamn at4!
02:04:31:22,02:04:33:04,"Take him out, now!"
02:04:33:18,02:04:35:04,Provide some cover!
02:04:35:08,02:04:37:04,"Move, move, move! Let's go!"
02:04:37:08,02:04:38:15,"Move, move, move!"
02:05:49:00,02:05:50:00,Wheeler!
02:05:51:13,02:05:52:13,Get outta there!
02:05:52:17,02:05:53:21,Come on!
02:05:59:13,02:06:00:13,Ives!
02:06:02:15,02:06:04:06,Splinter unit. Here.
02:06:06:01,02:06:08:04,"You know, it's going to be a beautiful sunset."
02:06:08:08,02:06:12:07,I'll get Max brought back. We should share the moment with him.
02:06:12:23,02:06:14:22,I'll make you a drink.
02:06:15:22,02:06:17:21,Bring my son back to the boat.
02:06:24:10,02:06:25:17,"We're runnin' out of time, let's go!"
02:06:25:18,02:06:27:20,"If they see us, it's all for nothing."
02:06:31:15,02:06:32:18,We need a distraction.
02:06:32:22,02:06:34:11,Don't worry about that.
02:06:38:03,02:06:39:13,On my Mark!
02:06:42:09,02:06:44:00,"Rpg, hit the base!"
02:06:45:01,02:06:46:08,That building on my Mark!
02:06:48:05,02:06:50:00,Three! Two!
02:06:50:04,02:06:51:22,One! Fire!
02:06:53:02,02:06:54:05,Fire!
02:07:09:05,02:07:10:13,Move! Move!
02:07:26:06,02:07:28:06,We're committed now. Come on.
02:07:34:14,02:07:36:03,What's that?
02:07:36:08,02:07:38:19,I borrowed it from the CIA.
02:07:40:03,02:07:41:04,What is it?
02:07:41:08,02:07:43:13,The way the world ends.
02:07:43:18,02:07:46:05,"Not with a bang, but a whimper."
02:07:46:15,02:07:48:08,I don't understand.
02:07:48:12,02:07:50:10,"When I take this, it's all over."
02:07:51:08,02:07:53:05,Then don't take it yet.
02:07:56:06,02:07:57:21,Why not?
02:07:59:11,02:08:01:09,Because we have the sunset coming.
02:08:01:20,02:08:04:07,And a little vodka left.
02:08:04:11,02:08:06:10,And Max will be here soon.
02:08:06:14,02:08:10:14,"They said they thought it was you, not Anna, ashore with Max."
02:08:13:10,02:08:16:20,So long as you can tell the difference.
02:08:19:01,02:08:21:15,"A moment's business, my love."
02:08:33:21,02:08:35:04,"Mahir, do you copy?"
02:08:35:08,02:08:38:09,"Not clear. I repeat, not clear!"
02:08:38:13,02:08:39:13,Copy that.
02:08:39:19,02:08:42:22,"I repeat, not clear!"
02:09:09:11,02:09:10:13,Neil!
02:09:11:08,02:09:12:10,Neill
02:09:25:07,02:09:26:10,Go!
02:09:35:08,02:09:38:00,We don't have anything big enough to blow this.
02:09:44:08,02:09:45:23,Try him. See if he's got a grenade.
02:09:50:18,02:09:51:18,Anything?
02:09:51:22,02:09:52:24,"Nah, nothing."
02:09:53:01,02:09:55:02,"Here, you try having a look. Can you pick it?"
02:09:55:20,02:09:57:01,I hope not.
02:09:57:05,02:09:59:01,I paid a lot for that lock.
02:09:59:05,02:10:01:23,How do you like where my journey began and yours ends?
02:10:02:03,02:10:03:15,Little radioactive for my taste.
02:10:03:19,02:10:06:17,My fate was always bound up with radiation.
02:10:07:22,02:10:10:07,We'd work where no one else would.
02:10:10:17,02:10:13:04,I made a bargain with the devil.
02:10:13:08,02:10:14:22,Money for time.
02:10:15:02,02:10:17:00,We sold our futures.
02:10:17:04,02:10:19:22,And now you're about to make the same mistake for the entire world.
02:10:20:14,02:10:23:09,It wasn't a mistake. I made the bargain I could.
02:10:23:14,02:10:24:19,What was yours?
02:10:24:23,02:10:27:10,You fight for a cause you barely understand...
02:10:28:05,02:10:31:16,"With people you trust so little, you've told them nothing."
02:10:31:21,02:10:33:23,"When I die, the world dies with me."
02:10:34:03,02:10:36:05,"And your knowledge dies with you,"
02:10:36:09,02:10:39:21,buried in a tomb like an anonymous Egyptian builder
02:10:40:01,02:10:42:11,sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret.
02:10:42:15,02:10:45:01,Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.
02:11:05:19,02:11:08:08,What's more fanatical than trying to destroy the world?
02:11:08:09,02:11:10:19,"I'm not, I'm creating a new one."
02:11:11:09,02:11:15:05,"Somewhere, sometime, a man in a crystalline tower throws a switch"
02:11:15:19,02:11:19:09,and armageddon is both triggered and avoided.
02:11:19:13,02:11:22:22,Now time itself switches direction.
02:11:23:02,02:11:25:10,The same sunshine we basked in
02:11:25:14,02:11:29:10,will warm the faces of our descendants generations to come.
02:11:29:14,02:11:31:12,How could they wanna kill us?
02:11:31:16,02:11:34:20,Because their oceans Rose and their rivers ran dry.
02:11:35:00,02:11:38:14,Don't you see? They have no choice but to turn back.
02:11:39:05,02:11:41:04,We're responsible.
02:11:54:18,02:11:57:06,"Knowing this, do you still want me to stop?"
02:11:58:13,02:11:59:15,Yes.
02:12:00:07,02:12:02:08,Each generation looks out for its own survival.
02:12:02:12,02:12:04:08,That's exactly what they're doing.
02:12:04:12,02:12:06:16,But not you. You're a traitor.
02:12:06:20,02:12:09:18,"Bringing death to all, because you have no life of your own left."
02:12:09:22,02:12:11:15,"When I'm done, life continues."
02:12:11:19,02:12:13:09,Not your son's.
02:12:13:13,02:12:17:04,My greatest sin was to bring a son into a world I knew was ending.
02:12:17:08,02:12:19:03,You think god will forgive me?
02:12:24:23,02:12:26:02,Walit!
02:12:27:03,02:12:28:03,Wait!
02:12:29:04,02:12:30:12,God...
02:12:41:20,02:12:43:09,Cover me!
02:12:51:06,02:12:53:02,Go! Go! Gol
02:12:54:22,02:12:57:13,"you don't believe in god, or a future,"
02:12:57:15,02:12:59:16,or anything outside of your own experience.
02:12:59:20,02:13:02:06,The rest is belief.
02:13:02:19,02:13:04:18,And I don't have it.
02:13:05:09,02:13:07:07,"Without it, you're not human."
02:13:07:12,02:13:08:21,You're just a madman.
02:13:09:13,02:13:11:12,Or a god.
02:13:11:17,02:13:12:13,Of sorts.
02:13:12:17,02:13:13:17,Like I said.
02:13:16:24,02:13:18:11,Don't. Jesus.
02:13:19:03,02:13:20:08,Our time is up.
02:13:27:02,02:13:29:01,I'll give your love to my wife.
02:13:29:17,02:13:31:14,You're forgetting. I haven't met her yet.
02:13:32:03,02:13:33:03,That's right.
02:13:33:06,02:13:34:21,"After you meet her, she dies."
02:13:35:01,02:13:37:12,I'll just give her my love instead.
02:13:38:19,02:13:39:19,Don't do...
02:13:41:06,02:13:42:16,Volkov...
02:13:56:05,02:13:57:24,"Enough business, my love."
02:14:25:04,02:14:27:19,"You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?"
02:14:30:00,02:14:32:14,But it sounds terribly important.
02:14:34:18,02:14:35:23,Where are you going?
02:14:36:04,02:14:37:09,Aren't you hot?
02:14:54:03,02:14:55:04,What are you doing now?
02:14:55:16,02:14:57:01,I spilled sunscreen.
02:14:57:14,02:14:59:10,- So what? - Slippery!
02:15:02:18,02:15:04:04,Just come here.
02:15:07:10,02:15:08:10,Turn over.
02:15:08:19,02:15:10:04,You'll like it.
02:15:44:17,02:15:46:02,I can't do this.
02:15:47:05,02:15:49:16,"- I can't let you think you've won. - Don't spoil this moment, Kat."
02:15:49:16,02:15:52:09,I'm not letting you go to your grave thinking we're coming with you.
02:15:55:02,02:15:56:12,"You're dying alone, andrei."
02:15:56:15,02:15:57:21,"Come on, come on, come on!"
02:15:57:22,02:16:00:06,"Tunnel's sealed, gate's closed."
02:16:00:18,02:16:02:05,"Mahir, do you copy?"
02:16:02:17,02:16:03:13,Yeanh.
02:16:03:17,02:16:05:13,"Hold. I repeat, hold!"
02:16:10:21,02:16:11:22,Look in my eyes.
02:16:13:11,02:16:14:22,Which do you see?
02:16:16:01,02:16:18:23,Despair or anger?
02:16:20:13,02:16:22:12,I'm not the woman who could find love for you
02:16:22:14,02:16:24:13,even though you scarred her on the inside.
02:16:26:08,02:16:30:04,I'm the vengeful bitch you scarred on the outside.
02:16:33:09,02:16:34:09,No!
02:16:53:14,02:16:54:14,Shit.
02:16:54:24,02:16:57:16,"Ives, she's killed him. Ives, do you copy? She's killed him."
02:16:58:01,02:17:00:19,She jumped the gun. She killed him.
02:17:19:06,02:17:21:18,"Come on, come on! Do you think they made it?"
02:17:26:07,02:17:27:11,"Ah, screw it."
02:18:38:03,02:18:40:16,Kat! You jumped the gun!
02:18:40:20,02:18:42:12,I couldn't do it.
02:18:42:17,02:18:44:16,I couldn't let him die thinking he'd won.
02:18:44:22,02:18:46:24,I knew you'd find a way.
02:18:47:18,02:18:49:14,"Wait, you found a way, we're okay, right?"
02:18:49:18,02:18:51:20,"Yeah, found a way. Be safe."
02:19:13:14,02:19:14:20,Thought you were inverted.
02:19:15:05,02:19:16:22,Changed gears halfway.
02:19:18:10,02:19:20:03,Looked like you needed help here.
02:19:20:07,02:19:22:10,Here? We needed help down there.
02:19:23:18,02:19:24:22,How'd you get that lock open?
02:19:25:24,02:19:28:02,Wasn't me. Didn't your team need you?
02:19:29:04,02:19:30:21,I'll get 'em on the next pass.
02:19:31:16,02:19:32:16,"All right, ives?"
02:19:33:05,02:19:35:01,Once I've caught my breath.
02:19:49:03,02:19:51:12,No one who's seen this leaves the field.
02:20:00:09,02:20:01:21,All right.
02:20:05:10,02:20:06:18,We hide it.
02:20:07:16,02:20:09:03,We end our lives.
02:20:09:22,02:20:12:03,That's the only way to be sure.
02:20:13:21,02:20:15:17,As to when...
02:20:16:04,02:20:18:13,Maybe that's every man's decision to make for himself.
02:20:19:16,02:20:20:23,You're not gonna kill us?
02:20:21:03,02:20:23:12,"If I ever find you, I will."
02:20:23:16,02:20:25:03,But you won't look too hard?
02:20:26:04,02:20:27:08,"Yes, I will."
02:20:31:03,02:20:33:06,"You're not going back to London to check on Kat, are you?"
02:20:33:06,02:20:34:02,No.
02:20:34:06,02:20:35:19,It's far too dangerous.
02:20:36:15,02:20:38:05,Even from afar?
02:20:39:11,02:20:40:21,Even from afar.
02:20:43:04,02:20:44:08,Ives!
02:20:45:08,02:20:46:14,Wait.
02:20:52:23,02:20:54:10,Are you really going back in?
02:20:57:08,02:21:00:04,"I'm the only one who could've got that door open in time, right, ives?"
02:21:00:13,02:21:02:24,"Well, I don't know any locksmiths as good as you."
02:21:04:11,02:21:05:13,See?
02:21:06:07,02:21:08:03,"It's me in there, again."
02:21:08:18,02:21:11:16,Weaving another past in the fabric of this mission.
02:21:20:06,02:21:21:06,"Neil, wait!"
02:21:25:15,02:21:27:06,Just saved the world.
02:21:27:18,02:21:29:15,Can't leave anything to chance.
02:21:30:06,02:21:32:11,But can we change things if we do it differently?
02:21:33:04,02:21:35:09,"""What's happened's happened.”"
02:21:35:13,02:21:38:12,Which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world.
02:21:39:05,02:21:40:18,It's not an excuse to do nothing.
02:21:41:08,02:21:42:04,Fate?
02:21:42:08,02:21:43:16,Call it what you want.
02:21:44:03,02:21:45:03,What do you call it?
02:21:45:24,02:21:47:03,Reality.
02:21:49:19,02:21:51:02,Now let me go.
02:21:56:19,02:21:59:08,"Hey, you never did tell me who recruited you, Neil."
02:21:59:12,02:22:01:05,Haven't you guessed by now?
02:22:02:05,02:22:03:05,You did.
02:22:03:22,02:22:06:11,Only not when you thought.
02:22:06:15,02:22:08:23,You have a future in the past.
02:22:09:04,02:22:12:02,Years ago for me. Years from now for you.
02:22:13:04,02:22:14:13,You've known me for years?
02:22:16:10,02:22:20:05,"For me, I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship."
02:22:20:09,02:22:22:04,"But for me, it's just the beginning."
02:22:22:21,02:22:24:19,We get up to some stuff.
02:22:25:05,02:22:27:16,You're gonna love it. You'll see.
02:22:28:13,02:22:30:19,This whole operation's a temporal pincer.
02:22:31:09,02:22:32:15,Whose?
02:22:34:02,02:22:35:02,Yours!
02:22:35:21,02:22:37:10,You're only halfway there.
02:22:37:14,02:22:39:09,"I'll see you at the beginning, friend."
02:22:48:04,02:22:51:08,We're the people saving the world from what might have been.
02:22:51:12,02:22:53:07,World will never know what could've happened.
02:22:55:07,02:22:58:01,"And even if they did, they wouldn't care."
02:23:02:09,02:23:04:15,'Cause no one cares about the bomb that didn't go off.
02:23:06:04,02:23:07:09,Only the one that did.
02:23:09:24,02:23:11:06,Do it before the boy comes out.
02:23:14:02,02:23:17:03,That's your idea of mercy? You gave me your word.
02:23:17:07,02:23:20:08,And I told you then what it would be worth.
02:23:20:20,02:23:22:17,"Here, today."
02:23:24:02,02:23:25:14,How did you know?
02:23:27:17,02:23:30:07,"Cannon place, 3:00. Probably nothing, I'm..."
02:23:30:19,02:23:31:15,Posterity.
02:23:31:19,02:23:35:06,"Cannon place, 3:00. Probably nothing, I'm..."
02:23:36:03,02:23:39:00,I told you you'd have to start looking differently at the world.
02:23:39:22,02:23:42:18,#NAME?
02:23:42:20,02:23:43:24,Then whose was it?
02:23:44:02,02:23:45:12,Mine.
02:23:45:16,02:23:48:18,I realized I wasn't working for you. We've both been working for me.
02:23:49:11,02:23:51:07,I'm the protagonist.
02:23:53:20,02:23:55:20,Then you'd better tie up those loose ends.
02:23:59:17,02:24:01:03,Mission accomplished.
02:24:03:05,02:24:04:20,It's the bomb that didn't go off.
02:24:05:14,02:24:08:01,The danger no one knew was real.
02:24:13:14,02:24:16:10,That's the bomb with the real power to change the world.
02:24:36:08,02:24:39:14,You
02:24:40:18,02:24:45:18,don't know where we stand
