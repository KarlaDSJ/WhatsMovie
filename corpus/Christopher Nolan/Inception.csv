00:01:33:11,00:01:36:11,ATTENDANT [IN JAPANESE]:
00:02:09:19,00:02:12:13,Are you here to kill me?
00:02:20:05,00:02:22:17,I know what this is.
00:02:23:18,00:02:28:23,"I've seen one before. Many, many years ago."
00:02:30:14,00:02:34:11,It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.
00:02:37:11,00:02:42:14,A man possessed of some radical notions.
00:02:46:10,00:02:49:07,COBB: What is the most resilient parasite?
00:02:49:14,00:02:52:22,A bacteria? A virus?
00:02:53:12,00:02:54:18,An intestinal worm?
00:02:55:02,00:02:56:08,ARTHUR: Uh...
00:02:56:12,00:02:58:03,What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...
00:02:58:07,00:02:59:12,An idea.
00:03:00:19,00:03:03:07,Resilient. Highly contagious.
00:03:03:11,00:03:06:11,"Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate."
00:03:08:14,00:03:12:05,"An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks."
00:03:12:09,00:03:13:15,Right in there somewhere.
00:03:13:19,00:03:15:08,For someone like you to steal?
00:03:15:12,00:03:18:11,"Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered..."
00:03:18:15,00:03:21:01,...and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
00:03:21:05,00:03:22:11,It's called extraction.
00:03:22:15,00:03:26:04,"Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself..."
00:03:26:08,00:03:28:20,...from even the most skilled extractor.
00:03:29:00,00:03:30:04,How can you do that?
00:03:30:08,00:03:33:04,Because I am the most skilled extractor.
00:03:33:15,00:03:37:01,I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.
00:03:37:05,00:03:40:03,"And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep..."
00:03:40:07,00:03:42:15,...your defense is never down.
00:03:43:13,00:03:47:11,"Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me."
00:03:47:15,00:03:50:23,I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...
00:03:51:04,00:03:53:12,"...better than your therapist, better than anyone."
00:03:53:22,00:03:56:14,"If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets..."
00:03:56:18,00:03:59:02,...I need to know what's in that safe.
00:03:59:06,00:04:02:17,"In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in."
00:04:05:14,00:04:10:05,"Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal."

00:35:45:14,00:35:48:21,Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.
00:35:49:08,00:35:52:07,Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud?

00:36:11:22,00:36:13:22,You need the simplest version of the idea...
00:36:14:02,00:36:17:18,...in order for it to grow naturally in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.
00:36:17:22,00:36:20:11,"So, what is this idea that you need to plant?"

01:06:58:06,01:06:59:11,Get him!
01:07:06:04,01:07:07:15,Are you all right?
01:07:07:19,01:07:09:23,"Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay."
01:07:10:03,01:07:12:01,"Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick."
01:07:12:05,01:07:13:11,Saito?
01:07:32:08,01:07:34:11,COBB: Get Fischer in the back room now.
01:07:34:19,01:07:37:11,#NAME?
01:07:37:22,01:07:39:09,COBB: Has he been shot? Is he dying?
01:07:39:13,01:07:41:07,ARTHUR: I don't know. - Jesus Christ.
01:07:41:11,01:07:43:21,ARTHUR: What happened to you? - Blocked by a freight train.
01:07:44:01,01:07:46:00,Why put a train in a downtown intersection?
01:07:46:04,01:07:47:19,- I didn't. ARTHUR: Where'd it come from?
01:07:47:24,01:07:49:16,Why the hell were we ambushed?
01:07:49:20,01:07:52:06,"Those were not normal projections. They'd been trained, for God's sakes."
01:07:54:08,01:07:55:23,- How could he be trained? - Fischer's had an extractor...
01:07:56:03,01:08:00:08,"...teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized."
01:08:00:12,01:08:02:03,It should've shown in the research.
01:08:02:07,01:08:04:02,COBB: Why the hell didn't it? - Calm down.
01:08:04:06,01:08:05:14,COBB: Don't tell me to calm down!
01:08:05:18,01:08:08:16,"This was your job, goddamn it! This was your responsibility!"
01:08:08:20,01:08:10:22,You were meant to check Fischer's background!
01:08:11:02,01:08:14:10,- We are not prepared for this! - We have dealt with sub-security before!
01:08:14:14,01:08:16:16,We'll be more careful and we're gonna be fine!
01:08:16:20,01:08:18:16,This was not a part of the plan! He's dying.
01:08:18:20,01:08:19:21,Put him out his misery.
01:08:20:01,01:08:22:21,"- No, don't do that! Don't do that. - Cobb, hey, hey."
01:08:23:01,01:08:25:04,He's in agony. I'm waking him up.
01:08:25:08,01:08:27:05,No. It won't wake him up.
01:08:27:09,01:08:31:01,"What do you mean, it won't wake him up? When we die in a dream, we wake up."
01:08:31:05,01:08:32:11,Not from this.
01:08:32:15,01:08:35:04,We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.
01:08:35:18,01:08:37:11,"Right. So, what happens when we die?"
01:08:37:15,01:08:39:11,#NAME?

01:08:42:08,01:08:45:14,"ARIADNE: What the hell is down there? - Just raw, infinite subconscious."
01:08:45:18,01:08:48:23,"Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind..."
01:08:49:03,01:08:52:01,...by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.
01:08:52:05,01:08:54:02,"Which, in our case, is just you."
01:08:54:06,01:08:56:23,- How long could we be stuck? YUSUF: Can't even think about...
01:08:57:03,01:08:59:13,...trying to escape until the sedation... - How long?
01:08:59:17,01:09:02:22,"Decades. It could be infinite. Ask him, he's the one who's been there."
01:09:03:02,01:09:04:07,ARTHUR: Let's get him upstairs.
01:09:04:11,01:09:05:18,[GROANING]
01:09:05:22,01:09:07:09,Great.
01:09:08:09,01:09:09:21,Thank you.
01:09:10:13,01:09:13:20,"So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army."
01:09:13:24,01:09:15:11,And if we get killed...
01:09:15:15,01:09:18:21,"...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?"
01:09:25:18,01:09:27:14,ARTHUR: Someone got first aid?
01:09:29:20,01:09:33:07,- You knew these risks and didn't tell us? - There weren't meant to be risks.
01:09:33:11,01:09:36:10,- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire. - You had no right.
01:09:36:14,01:09:38:22,This was the only way to go three layers deep.
01:09:39:02,01:09:41:02,You knew about this and went along with it?
01:09:41:06,01:09:42:07,I trusted him.
01:09:42:11,01:09:44:09,When? When he promised you half his share?
01:09:44:13,01:09:47:19,"No. His whole share. Besides, he said he'd done it before."
01:09:47:23,01:09:50:01,"What, with Mal? Because that worked so good?"
01:09:50:05,01:09:53:15,That has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to to get to my children.
01:09:53:20,01:09:55:18,You led us into a war zone with no way out?
01:09:55:22,01:09:59:23,"There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible..."
01:10:00:03,01:10:02:11,"...and we get out using the kick, just like before."
01:10:02:15,01:10:05:02,"Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes."
01:10:05:06,01:10:07:03,I am sitting this one out on this level.
01:10:07:07,01:10:09:17,COBB: Fischer's security is surrounding this place.
01:10:09:21,01:10:12:03,Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.
01:10:12:07,01:10:16:01,That means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee you.
01:10:16:15,01:10:20:10,We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.
01:10:22:00,01:10:24:11,Downwards is the only way forwards.
01:10:26:00,01:10:27:03,Get ready.

01:10:34:08,01:10:37:10,I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million.

01:10:46:13,01:10:47:23,I don't know any safe.

01:10:52:16,01:10:53:24,Tell us what it is.
01:10:54:20,01:10:56:14,I don't know.
01:11:01:12,01:11:03:16,We have it on good authority you do know.
01:11:03:20,01:11:06:04,Yeah? Whose authority?
01:11:07:16,01:11:11:04,"- Five hundred dollars, this cost. EAMES: What's inside it?"
01:11:11:10,01:11:15:04,"Cash, cards, ID. And this."
01:11:20:06,01:11:21:18,Useful?
01:11:22:12,01:11:23:13,Maybe.
01:11:23:24,01:11:25:19,You're on. You've got an hour.
01:11:26:05,01:11:27:05,An hour?
01:11:28:13,01:11:30:19,I was supposed to have all night to crack this.
01:11:30:23,01:11:33:13,And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
01:11:33:17,01:11:36:21,"You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please."
01:11:37:18,01:11:39:06,[SCREAMING]

01:11:48:12,01:11:50:15,Just make them stop.

01:12:32:18,01:12:35:06,"No, he never gave me any combination."
01:12:36:00,01:12:40:04,"Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just didn't know it was a combination."
01:12:40:08,01:12:41:13,"Well, what, then?"
01:12:41:17,01:12:44:06,"I don't know, some meaningful combination of numbers..."
01:12:44:10,01:12:48:08,...based on your experiences with Maurice.
01:12:50:01,01:12:53:23,"We didn't have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together."
01:12:54:17,01:12:56:04,Perhaps after your mother died.
01:12:58:20,01:13:01:13,"After my mother died, you know what he told me?"

01:13:14:07,01:13:17:13,- How's he doing? - He's in a lot of pain.
01:13:17:17,01:13:21:07,"When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense."
01:13:21:12,01:13:22:18,And if he dies?
01:13:23:22,01:13:25:09,Worst-case scenario?
01:13:25:13,01:13:28:06,"When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone."

01:14:13:01,01:14:14:13,All right. What is in the safe?
01:14:15:15,01:14:16:19,Something for you.
01:14:17:10,01:14:21:13,Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.
01:14:22:07,01:14:25:09,- A will. - Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
01:14:25:13,01:14:26:18,That's an alternate.
01:14:26:22,01:14:29:07,This would supersede the other if you want it to.
01:14:29:11,01:14:32:02,It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.
01:14:32:06,01:14:35:23,It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
01:14:36:03,01:14:38:14,Destroying my whole inheritance?
01:14:40:06,01:14:43:10,- Why would he suggest such a thing? - I just don't know.
01:14:46:08,01:14:48:07,"He loved you, Robert."
01:14:48:21,01:14:50:12,In his own way.

01:15:08:22,01:15:10:13,He pulled me close.
01:15:13:05,01:15:15:07,And I could only make out...
