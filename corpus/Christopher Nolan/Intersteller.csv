00:31:59:00,00:32:02:03,- Is that a Wormhole? - It appeared 48 years ago.
00:32:02:14,00:32:04:12,COOPER: And it leads where?
00:32:05:01,00:32:06:16,PROF. BRAND: Another galaxy.
00:32:08:10,00:32:10:16,COOPER: A wormhole's not a naturally occurring phenomenon.
00:32:10:20,00:32:12:06,BRAND: Someone placed it there.
00:32:13:01,00:32:14:13,"-""They""? - Mm."
00:32:15:01,00:32:19:04,"And whoever they are, they appear to be looking out for us."
00:32:19:15,00:32:22:05,That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.
00:32:22:09,00:32:24:07,It came along right as we needed it.
00:32:24:11,00:32:27:09,DOYLE: They've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach.
00:32:27:13,00:32:29:11,"Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes."
00:32:29:15,00:32:31:24,#NAME?
00:32:32:04,00:32:35:04,PROF. BRAND: We sent people into it. Ten years ago.
00:32:36:12,00:32:38:04,The Lazarus missions.
00:32:38:12,00:32:39:17,PROF. BRAND: Twelve possible worlds...
00:32:39:21,00:32:42:05,...twelve Ranger launches carrying...
00:32:42:16,00:32:45:02,...the bravest humans ever to live...
00:32:45:06,00:32:47:21,...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
00:32:48:09,00:32:51:09,DOYLE: Each person's landing pod had enough life support for two years.
00:32:51:13,00:32:53:12,But they could use hibernation to stretch that...
00:32:53:16,00:32:56:21,...making observations on organics over a decade or more.
00:32:57:01,00:33:00:22,"Their mission was to assess their world, and if it showed potential..."
00:33:01:06,00:33:05:16,"...then they could send out a signal, bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued."
00:33:05:20,00:33:07:21,And what if the world didn't show promise?
00:33:08:12,00:33:09:22,Hence the bravery.
00:33:10:17,00:33:13:06,You don't have the resources to visit all 12.
00:33:13:10,00:33:14:13,No.
00:33:15:10,00:33:18:05,Data transmission back through the Wormhole is rudimentary.
00:33:18:09,00:33:23:10,Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us some clue as to which worlds have potential.
00:33:23:14,00:33:25:09,And one system shows promise.
00:33:25:17,00:33:28:06,"One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?"
00:33:29:02,00:33:31:22,BRAND: One system with three potential worlds?
00:33:32:08,00:33:33:22,No long shot.
00:33:36:02,00:33:37:05,COOPER: Okay.
00:33:37:22,00:33:40:06,So if we find a home...
00:33:42:23,00:33:46:10,...then what? - That's the long shot.
00:33:46:18,00:33:49:23,PROF. BRAND: There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
00:33:50:11,00:33:53:10,Did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber?
00:34:05:03,00:34:08:01,COOPER: This entire facility's a centrifuge.
00:34:08:09,00:34:10:21,Some kind of vehicle. A space station?
00:34:11:05,00:34:12:23,PROF. BRAND: Both. Plan A.
00:34:13:03,00:34:15:05,COOPER: How do you get it off the ground?
00:34:15:09,00:34:19:01,PROF. BRAND: The first gravitational anomalies changed everything.
00:34:19:09,00:34:23:17,Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real.
00:34:24:02,00:34:28:18,So I started working on a theory and we started building this station.
00:34:29:03,00:34:31:05,But you haven't solved it yet.
00:34:32:07,00:34:33:20,BRAND: That's why there's Plan B.
00:34:34:08,00:34:39:01,The problem is gravity. How to get a viable amount of human life off the planet.
00:34:39:05,00:34:40:12,This is one way.
00:34:40:20,00:34:43:08,Plan B: a population bomb.
00:34:43:16,00:34:48:10,"Over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under 900 kilos."
00:34:49:03,00:34:50:15,How would you raise them?
00:34:50:19,00:34:53:06,"With equipment on board, we incubate the first 10."
00:34:53:10,00:34:57:07,"After that, with surrogacy, the growth becomes exponential."
00:34:58:00,00:35:01:07,"Within 30 years, we could have a colony of hundreds."
00:35:01:11,00:35:04:20,The real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity.
00:35:05:11,00:35:07:01,This takes care of that.
00:35:07:05,00:35:09:16,COOPER: But what about the people here? You just...
00:35:10:01,00:35:11:09,...give up on them?
00:35:11:24,00:35:13:06,My kids?
00:35:13:19,00:35:17:03,That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

00:35:38:03,00:35:40:19,...I will have solved the problem of gravity.
00:35:41:18,00:35:43:08,I give you my word.

00:36:19:01,00:36:22:19,"COOPER: What, because heading out there is what I feel like I was born to do?"
00:36:23:18,00:36:25:14,And it excites me? Heh.
00:36:26:07,00:36:28:18,"No, that does not make it wrong."
00:36:28:22,00:36:30:02,It might.
00:36:30:11,00:36:33:14,DONALD: Don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason.
00:36:34:08,00:36:36:16,"The why of the thing, that's the foundation."
00:36:36:20,00:36:38:22,And the foundation's solid.
00:36:42:02,00:36:47:02,"We farmers, we sit here every year when the rains fail and we say:"

00:37:09:13,00:37:12:19,"Tom will be all right, but you got to make things right with Murph."
00:37:12:23,00:37:13:24,I Will.
00:37:14:23,00:37:18:03,Without making promises you don't know you can keep.
00:37:28:18,00:37:30:18,"You have to talk to me, Murph."
00:37:33:06,00:37:35:09,I need to fix this before I go.
00:37:35:13,00:37:38:10,MURPH: Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.
00:37:40:00,00:37:45:00,"COOPER: After you kids came along, your mom said something to me I never quite understood."
00:37:45:09,00:37:47:00,"She said, ""Now..."

00:37:58:13,00:38:01:01,And I think that now I understand what she meant.
00:38:04:19,00:38:08:13,"Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future."
00:38:10:04,00:38:12:08,MURPH: You said ghosts didn't exist.
00:38:18:19,00:38:20:07,"COOPER: That's right, Murph."
00:38:23:12,00:38:24:20,"Murph, look at me."
00:38:27:21,00:38:30:09,I can't be your ghost right now.
