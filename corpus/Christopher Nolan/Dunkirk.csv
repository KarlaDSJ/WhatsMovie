00:02:38:22,00:02:40:04,English! I'm English!
00:05:40:01,00:05:41:19,"It's grenadiers, mate."
00:05:55:15,00:05:56:23,Make way!
00:06:00:19,00:06:02:09,Out of the way!
00:06:02:14,00:06:04:01,"Go, go, go!"
00:06:04:11,00:06:06:08,Along the mole. All the way.
00:06:06:14,00:06:08:08,The ship's about to leave.
00:06:09:09,00:06:11:13,Along the mole. All the way. The ship's about to leave.
00:07:45:15,00:07:47:15,Where's the bloody air force?
00:08:35:00,00:08:37:08,The navy's requisitioned her.
00:08:37:12,00:08:40:11,They'll be back in an hour. My dad wants to be ready before then.
00:08:42:13,00:08:45:04,They've told us to strip her and load those life jackets.
00:08:45:10,00:08:48:05,"Some men across the Channel, at Dunkirk, need taking off."
00:08:48:14,00:08:49:15,Some men?
00:09:09:19,00:09:11:21,"Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2."
00:09:16:03,00:09:17:04,70 gallons.
00:09:19:12,00:09:21:09,"68 gallons, Fortis Leader."
00:09:22:06,00:09:24:18,Stay down at 500 feet to leave fuel
00:09:24:20,00:09:27:12,for 40-minute fighting time over Dunkirk.
00:09:28:05,00:09:31:03,"Understood. Vector 128, angels point five."
00:09:32:01,00:09:34:11,"And keep an eye on that gauge, even when it gets lively."
00:09:34:15,00:09:36:13,Save enough to get back.
00:10:45:04,00:10:49:01,No French soldiers. No French soldiers. No.
00:10:49:05,00:10:52:14,"No, no French. English only. English only past this point."
00:10:52:18,00:10:55:04,"No. It's a British ship. No, you have your own ships."
00:10:55:08,00:10:56:22,Get back. Get back.
00:10:57:02,00:10:59:05,"No, you've got your own ships. This is a British ship."
00:10:59:09,00:11:00:17,"No, get back."
00:11:00:21,00:11:02:21,"Look, get the stretchers through. There are stretchers coming."
00:11:02:22,00:11:04:22,Get out of the way! Out of the way!
00:11:05:02,00:11:08:01,"Go, go, go. Along the mole. All the way."
00:11:08:05,00:11:10:15,The ship's about to leave. About to leave.
00:11:10:19,00:11:11:22,Along the mole. All the way.
00:11:12:00,00:11:14:06,Along the mole. Along the mole. All the way. All the way.
00:11:14:12,00:11:15:12,No.
00:11:15:16,00:11:18:09,"No, English only. English only!"
00:11:21:10,00:11:22:10,No!
00:11:37:20,00:11:39:05,Ready on the stern!
00:11:39:09,00:11:40:09,"Yes, sir!"
00:11:51:16,00:11:53:03,Man the bowline!
00:11:53:07,00:11:54:17,Any more room?
00:12:02:06,00:12:03:22,You have to get back!
00:12:11:19,00:12:13:07,That's two minutes.
00:12:13:11,00:12:15:10,You've missed it. You've missed it.
00:12:43:16,00:12:44:16,Is that the last one?
00:12:45:04,00:12:46:06,"Aye, sir."
00:12:49:04,00:12:50:06,Break the line.
00:12:54:01,00:12:55:10,Come on! Come on!
00:13:51:19,00:13:54:08,Dunkirk's so far. Why can't they just load at Calais?
00:13:54:12,00:13:57:00,The enemy had something to say about it.
00:13:58:22,00:14:01:17,"Ah, down here we're sitting ducks."
00:14:01:22,00:14:04:13,Keep 'em peeled. They'll come out of the sun.
00:14:17:09,00:14:18:09,Up the line.
00:14:20:13,00:14:22:10,Oi. We'll take it.
00:14:24:18,00:14:26:04,Drop the gangplank!
00:14:26:08,00:14:27:08,"Yes, sir!"
00:14:44:11,00:14:45:18,Take a run at it.
00:15:15:15,00:15:17:13,"Ready on the stern line, George."
00:15:20:06,00:15:21:19,Aren't you waiting on the navy?
00:15:22:01,00:15:24:00,"They've asked for the Moonstone, they'll have her."
00:15:24:04,00:15:25:08,And her captain.
00:15:25:13,00:15:27:17,And his son.
00:15:30:10,00:15:31:23,"Thanks for the help, George."
00:15:35:12,00:15:37:01,What are you doing?
00:15:37:04,00:15:38:09,You do know where we're going?
00:15:40:05,00:15:41:05,France.
00:15:42:18,00:15:44:04,"Into war, George."
00:15:45:05,00:15:46:10,"I'll be useful, sir."
00:15:54:24,00:15:56:11,"Bandit, 11 o'clock."
00:15:57:11,00:15:58:16,Break.
00:16:12:05,00:16:13:05,He's on me.
00:16:15:14,00:16:16:21,I'm on him.
00:16:52:02,00:16:55:01,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight..."
00:16:55:06,00:16:56:06,"Oi, you two."
00:16:56:11,00:16:57:19,Get a shift on.
00:16:59:11,00:17:02:09,"Yeah, pull him tight. Tie a knot in it."
00:17:02:13,00:17:04:11,Back up the line. Both of you.
00:17:04:15,00:17:06:01,Off you go.
00:17:06:05,00:17:07:09,Off you go!
00:17:07:13,00:17:09:21,That last barrage has damaged the rudder.
00:17:10:05,00:17:11:09,"Uh, okay..."
00:17:12:04,00:17:13:20,Psst!
00:17:49:19,00:17:50:19,Mr. Dawson!
00:17:50:23,00:17:52:08,"One of ours, George."
00:19:02:11,00:19:04:15,"On my mark, Fortis 2. Draw him left."
00:19:06:20,00:19:08:15,"Three, two, one."
00:19:09:04,00:19:10:05,Mark.
00:19:24:11,00:19:25:13,Clear.
00:19:28:23,00:19:30:16,Is he down?
00:19:39:06,00:19:40:12,"Yeah, he's down for the count."
00:19:47:00,00:19:49:06,"Fortis Leader, one bandit down."
00:19:53:04,00:19:55:01,"Fortis Leader, do you read?"
00:20:00:18,00:20:04:07,"Fortis 2, I have you to my port. I have no eyes on Fortis Leader. Over."
00:20:04:11,00:20:06:14,"Understood, Fortis 1."
00:20:06:18,00:20:08:04,Orbit for a look.
00:20:20:21,00:20:22:03,"How long, Lieutenant?"
00:20:22:07,00:20:25:09,"We need to run a new cable, sir. They're scrambling."
00:20:25:13,00:20:26:20,Very well.
00:20:31:16,00:20:34:14,"Colonel, you're gonna have to decide how many more wounded to evacuate."
00:20:34:18,00:20:37:08,One stretcher takes the space of seven standing men.
00:20:37:12,00:20:38:14,Excuse me.
00:20:52:21,00:20:54:17,#NAME?
00:20:57:07,00:20:58:16,How's the perimeter?
00:20:58:20,00:21:00:08,Shrinking every day.
00:21:00:19,00:21:03:14,"But between our rear guard and the French, we're holding the line."
00:21:04:02,00:21:05:22,And the enemy tanks have stopped.
00:21:06:02,00:21:07:11,Why have they stopped?
00:21:08:01,00:21:09:04,Waste precious tanks
00:21:09:09,00:21:11:06,"when they can pick us off from the air, like fish in a barrel?"
00:21:11:06,00:21:14:08,How long does London expect the army to hold out before we make terms?
00:21:14:12,00:21:15:12,Make terms?
00:21:16:04,00:21:19:12,They're not stopping here. We need to get our army back.
00:21:20:02,00:21:22:19,Britain's next and then the rest of the world.
00:21:22:23,00:21:24:01,Christ.
00:21:24:20,00:21:27:09,"I mean, you can practically see it from here."
00:21:27:13,00:21:28:16,What?
00:21:29:14,00:21:30:20,Home.
00:21:31:22,00:21:33:13,What about the French?
00:21:33:17,00:21:36:01,"Publicly, Churchill's told them, ""Bras dessous."""
00:21:36:05,00:21:38:05,"Arm in arm, leaving together."
00:21:38:10,00:21:39:15,And privately?
00:21:39:19,00:21:41:07,We need our army back.
00:21:41:21,00:21:43:22,"How many men are they talking about, sir?"
00:21:44:22,00:21:48:10,"Churchill wants 30,000. Ramsay's hoping we can give him 45."
00:21:50:00,00:21:52:06,"There are 400,000 men on this beach, sir."
00:21:53:06,00:21:55:09,We'll just have to do our best.
00:21:56:13,00:21:59:02,"Right, well, this mole stays open at all costs."
00:22:00:07,00:22:04:06,"We're in artillery range from the west. If anything else sinks here,"
00:22:04:10,00:22:06:10,the mole's blocked and we're stuffed.
00:22:06:14,00:22:08:03,Can't we load from the beaches?
00:22:08:07,00:22:09:23,Better than standing out here when the dive bombs come.
00:22:09:24,00:22:11:09,- It's impossible. - Too shallow?
00:22:11:13,00:22:13:13,'Cause anything that drafts over three feet can't get near.
00:22:13:14,00:22:16:16,We don't have enough small boats to ferry men to the destroyers.
00:22:17:05,00:22:20:02,"The mole it is, then, gentlemen."
00:23:09:13,00:23:10:14,Hey!
00:23:11:13,00:23:13:17,Hey! Can you swim it?
00:23:15:18,00:23:16:22,"Dad, can you get closer?"
00:23:17:17,00:23:19:04,Can't risk it!
00:23:20:18,00:23:21:18,Hang on.
00:24:11:08,00:24:12:14,What's your name?
00:24:31:20,00:24:33:02,Wreckage below.
00:24:34:07,00:24:36:01,Is it more of the 109?
00:24:36:05,00:24:37:09,No.
00:24:37:16,00:24:39:08,It's Fortis Leader. Over.
00:24:40:21,00:24:41:21,You think he got out?
00:24:42:02,00:24:43:02,I didn't see a 'chute.
00:24:44:21,00:24:46:20,Record his position.
00:24:46:24,00:24:49:05,"Then set heading 128,"
00:24:49:09,00:24:51:06,"height 1,000. Over."
00:24:51:10,00:24:53:12,"Vector 128, angels one. Understood."
00:24:59:13,00:25:00:21,"Fortis 2, what's your fuel?"
00:25:02:06,00:25:03:09,50 gallons. Over.
00:25:03:21,00:25:06:05,50 gallons.
00:25:09:20,00:25:11:18,"All right, keep letting me know."
00:25:11:22,00:25:13:17,My gauge took a bit of a knock back there.
00:25:15:07,00:25:16:19,Shouldn't you turn back?
00:25:16:23,00:25:18:11,"No, no."
00:25:19:02,00:25:21:11,I'm fairly confident it's just the gauge.
00:26:50:17,00:26:52:18,- She's going down! - Cut her loose!
00:26:52:22,00:26:53:24,What about the wounded?
00:26:55:07,00:26:57:16,Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
00:27:00:01,00:27:01:12,"Cut her loose, and push her off!"
00:27:01:16,00:27:03:10,We can't let her sink at the mole!
00:27:04:03,00:27:05:23,Push the bloody boat off!
00:27:13:10,00:27:14:10,Help us!
00:28:27:18,00:28:29:15,Do you want to come below?
00:28:29:19,00:28:31:17,It's much warmer.
00:28:32:15,00:28:33:19,It's out of the wind.
00:28:33:23,00:28:35:09,Here you go.
00:28:38:02,00:28:39:16,"Leave him be, George."
00:28:39:20,00:28:41:16,He feels safer on deck.
00:28:42:14,00:28:44:06,You would too if you'd been bombed.
00:28:44:10,00:28:45:10,U-boat.
00:28:47:18,00:28:49:22,It was a U-boat.
00:28:53:21,00:28:55:04,"Get him some more tea, George."
00:29:10:04,00:29:12:11,"Right, we're about five minutes out,"
00:29:12:15,00:29:14:07,"so climb to 2,000. Over."
00:29:14:11,00:29:15:14,That's more fuel.
00:29:15:18,00:29:17:11,"I know, but I don't want to get jumped again."
00:29:17:11,00:29:18:14,Let's get a decent altitude.
00:29:18:15,00:29:20:14,We can dive down on the bastards from above. Over.
00:29:20:17,00:29:22:05,Understood. Angels two.
00:29:22:09,00:29:23:09,Over.
00:29:25:21,00:29:26:21,"Right, Highlanders."
00:29:27:10,00:29:29:00,Let's find you another ship.
00:30:41:03,00:30:42:03,Come on.
00:30:45:03,00:30:47:17,"Everyone else, keep climbing. Climb on the deck."
00:30:48:06,00:30:51:00,Climb on the deck.
00:30:51:12,00:30:53:13,Watch your heads on the rail. Watch it.
00:30:55:06,00:30:57:03,"That's right, keep going down. Take a blanket."
00:30:57:07,00:30:58:14,"Down you go. Put this on, my love."
00:30:59:05,00:31:02:02,Down you go. Keep going down.
00:31:02:06,00:31:04:09,There's a nice cup of tea for you down there.
00:31:04:13,00:31:05:13,Keep moving down.
00:31:05:17,00:31:07:09,Take a blanket.
00:31:08:14,00:31:09:14,Try and make some room.
00:31:09:18,00:31:11:04,"Keep moving down, boys."
00:31:12:12,00:31:13:14,This way.
00:31:14:17,00:31:16:07,A cup of tea down there.
00:31:41:01,00:31:43:24,There you go. Down there. Move down there.
00:32:03:05,00:32:04:16,What's wrong with your friend?
00:32:24:01,00:32:25:08,He's looking for a quick way out.
00:32:27:17,00:32:29:03,In case we go down.
00:33:07:16,00:33:09:02,Where are we going?
00:33:09:06,00:33:10:18,Dunkirk.
00:33:12:19,00:33:14:21,"No, uh, no, no, we're going to England."
00:33:16:14,00:33:18:14,We have to go to Dunkirk first.
00:33:19:03,00:33:21:22,"Look, I'm not going back."
00:33:23:08,00:33:24:21,I'm not going back.
00:33:25:20,00:33:27:03,Look at it.
00:33:28:09,00:33:30:00,"If we go there, we'll die."
00:33:37:04,00:33:38:04,"I see your point, son."
00:33:39:01,00:33:41:03,"Well, let's plot a course."
00:33:44:12,00:33:47:04,You can take your tea below and warm up.
00:33:49:18,00:33:52:08,"Peter, have we got space for a man to lie down?"
00:33:52:11,00:33:53:21,"Uh, yeah."
00:33:59:07,00:34:00:16,"Here, come on."
00:34:06:01,00:34:07:01,Careful.
00:34:09:11,00:34:10:15,Careful.
00:34:16:23,00:34:18:06,Just in there.
00:34:19:00,00:34:20:11,I'll get you some more tea.
00:34:37:06,00:34:38:19,"Is he a coward, Mr. Dawson?"
00:34:38:23,00:34:40:14,"He's shell-shocked, George."
00:34:40:18,00:34:42:08,He's not himself.
00:34:45:02,00:34:47:11,He may never be himself again.
00:34:56:00,00:34:57:05,Here you are.
00:35:14:19,00:35:16:17,"40 gallons, Fortis 1."
00:35:18:06,00:35:19:09,"40 gallons, understood."
00:35:23:13,00:35:24:24,"Heinkel, 11 o'clock."
00:35:25:10,00:35:28:08,She's lining up to drop her load on that minesweeper.
00:35:28:12,00:35:29:12,Fighters?
00:35:29:16,00:35:32:03,"Yeah, 109s off her starboard."
00:35:33:05,00:35:34:16,I'm on the bomber.
00:36:26:11,00:36:27:11,Got him! Got him!
00:36:59:20,00:37:01:15,"Oh, she's turning. You must've damaged her."
00:37:02:00,00:37:03:05,Where's the escort?
00:37:03:09,00:37:04:13,"Well, I got one of—"
00:37:05:05,00:37:06:05,Jesus!
00:37:25:01,00:37:26:07,I'm going down.
00:37:26:11,00:37:27:24,I'm on him. Bail out.
00:37:48:04,00:37:49:18,"No, the swell looks good. I'm ditching."
00:38:10:14,00:38:11:20,Don't leave us!
00:38:12:18,00:38:14:08,Come back!
00:38:14:21,00:38:17:09,- Wait for us! - Help! Help us!
00:38:20:05,00:38:23:15,Pick us up! Pick us up!
00:38:27:08,00:38:28:19,Come back!
00:38:30:13,00:38:31:18,Torpedo!
00:39:03:01,00:39:07:00,Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
00:40:53:13,00:40:54:18,Help!
00:40:54:22,00:40:56:14,Get us out of here!
00:41:11:07,00:41:12:14,"Spitfires, George."
00:41:12:18,00:41:15:02,Greatest plane ever built.
00:41:18:22,00:41:19:22,You didn't even look.
00:41:21:08,00:41:23:07,Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.
00:41:24:03,00:41:27:08,Sweetest sound you could hear out here.
00:41:28:03,00:41:29:03,Hello?
00:41:30:19,00:41:32:19,Could you open the door?
00:41:32:23,00:41:34:12,Hello? Can you hear me?
00:41:36:01,00:41:38:08,Open the door!
00:41:38:18,00:41:40:03,Do you hear me?
00:41:42:11,00:41:43:18,He wants to come out.
00:41:43:22,00:41:45:22,What have you done? Locked him in?
00:41:46:02,00:41:47:14,"Let him out, for God's sake."
00:41:47:18,00:41:48:18,Hello?
00:41:50:17,00:41:52:09,Let me out!
00:42:06:22,00:42:09:09,You haven't turned around.
00:42:11:23,00:42:13:18,No. We have a job to do.
00:42:15:03,00:42:18:07,Job? This is a pleasure yacht.
00:42:18:11,00:42:21:06,"You're weekend sailors, not the bloody navy."
00:42:21:22,00:42:23:13,A man your age?
00:42:24:00,00:42:26:11,Men my age dictate this war.
00:42:26:15,00:42:29:08,Why should we be allowed to send our children to fight it?
00:42:29:12,00:42:31:06,You should be at home!
00:42:31:08,00:42:35:00,"Well, there won't be any home if we allow a slaughter across the Channel."
00:42:42:01,00:42:43:18,He's turning tail. I'm gonna get after him.
00:42:45:17,00:42:46:17,Good luck.
00:42:46:21,00:42:49:21,Watch your fuel. You're at 15 gallons.
00:42:52:12,00:42:53:23,"15 gallons, understood."
00:42:56:01,00:42:57:15,"Best of luck, Collins."
00:43:00:16,00:43:02:20,"Collins, do you read?"
00:44:04:15,00:44:06:19,Oi! No! No!
00:44:06:23,00:44:08:17,Get off! Get off!
00:44:09:06,00:44:11:02,"Piss off, the both of you. It's too crowded."
00:44:11:06,00:44:12:12,You can't leave us!
00:44:13:14,00:44:14:15,Make some room!
00:44:14:19,00:44:15:19,No!
00:44:16:17,00:44:17:24,No! Get off!
00:44:18:04,00:44:19:16,"You men, leave off. You'll capsize the boat."
00:44:19:17,00:44:21:21,She's gone over twice on the way out here.
00:44:22:01,00:44:23:19,You have to stay calm. There are plenty of boats.
00:44:23:20,00:44:24:20,Calm?
00:44:24:24,00:44:27:06,"Wait till you get torpedoed, then tell us to be calm!"
00:44:27:19,00:44:29:02,You have life jackets?
00:44:29:06,00:44:30:14,"Yes, they do."
00:44:30:18,00:44:32:17,"Don't panic, boys. The water's not too rough"
00:44:32:21,00:44:33:23,or too cold.
00:44:34:03,00:44:35:16,We're heading back to the beach.
00:44:35:20,00:44:38:02,- Let's go to Dover! - Yeah!
00:44:38:20,00:44:40:16,"We can't make it across the Channel in this, lads."
00:44:40:16,00:44:44:03,We need to get back to the beach and wait for another ride.
00:44:44:11,00:44:47:06,"You men in the water, float here, save your strength."
00:44:47:10,00:44:48:23,We'll come back for you.
00:44:49:04,00:44:50:04,Oars in!
00:44:51:07,00:44:53:24,"Together, pull!"
00:44:55:06,00:44:57:13,"Together, pull!"
00:44:59:21,00:45:00:21,Pull!
00:45:01:22,00:45:04:02,"Together, pull!"
00:45:06:07,00:45:07:08,Pull!
00:45:08:22,00:45:11:09,"Together, pull!"
00:45:14:15,00:45:16:19,"There's no hiding from this, son."
00:45:19:02,00:45:21:18,"What is it you think you can do out there, on this thing?"
00:45:21:23,00:45:25:02,There's not just us. A call went out.
00:45:25:06,00:45:27:07,"We aren't the only ones to answer, you know."
00:45:27:11,00:45:29:03,You don't even have guns.
00:45:29:12,00:45:30:12,Do you have a gun?
00:45:30:16,00:45:33:11,"Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303."
00:45:33:15,00:45:36:16,Did it help you against the dive bombers and the U-boats?
00:45:37:21,00:45:39:13,You're an old fool.
00:45:40:18,00:45:42:14,I'm not going back.
00:45:43:04,00:45:44:10,I'm not going back.
00:45:45:03,00:45:46:03,Turn it around.
00:45:47:05,00:45:48:15,I'm not turning round.
00:45:49:07,00:45:50:11,Turn it around!
00:45:52:05,00:45:53:10,Turn it—
00:45:55:10,00:45:56:23,"- Calm it down, mate. - Turn it around!"
00:45:57:01,00:45:58:01,"Wait, wait!"
00:45:58:05,00:45:59:15,"Calm it down, mate."
00:46:01:02,00:46:02:02,George?
00:46:02:22,00:46:03:22,George!
00:46:06:17,00:46:07:17,What have you done?
00:46:09:10,00:46:10:21,"Okay, you're all right, George."
00:46:11:15,00:46:12:19,You're all right.
00:46:13:13,00:46:16:13,"Hang on. Okay. Okay, just..."
00:46:16:17,00:46:18:05,That's it. That's good enough.
00:46:18:09,00:46:21:07,It's gonna keep some pressure on. There we go.
00:46:21:11,00:46:23:01,There we go.
00:46:23:05,00:46:24:11,"Can you hear me, George?"
00:48:59:01,00:49:00:12,"Come on, lads!"
00:49:01:19,00:49:04:15,"Come on! Come on, boys!"
00:51:10:03,00:51:11:07,It's a pier.
00:51:12:09,00:51:13:23,For when the water comes in.
00:51:18:12,00:51:19:21,The tide's turning now.
00:51:21:23,00:51:22:23,How can you tell?
00:51:25:10,00:51:26:21,The bodies come back.
00:51:57:17,00:51:58:17,Hey.
00:52:11:01,00:52:12:17,"Hey, Highlanders!"
00:52:22:15,00:52:24:07,"Hey, Highlanders!"
00:52:24:11,00:52:25:16,What's that way?
00:52:26:07,00:52:27:08,A boat.
00:52:27:12,00:52:28:22,She's grounded.
00:52:29:02,00:52:31:04,"Not when the tide comes in, she's not."
00:52:48:10,00:52:51:01,Be a brave lad.
00:52:53:14,00:52:55:01,You and Mr. Dawson?
00:52:57:03,00:52:58:13,It's the best thing I've ever done.
00:52:59:07,00:53:01:17,You're all right. You're okay.
00:53:12:19,00:53:15:07,Sea Cadet. It's the only thing I've ever done.
00:53:15:11,00:53:17:15,It's all right. It's okay. Just have some water.
00:53:20:11,00:53:22:03,I told my dad...
00:53:22:07,00:53:24:11,I've done nothing at school
00:53:26:09,00:53:28:13,and that I would do something one day.
00:53:31:08,00:53:33:19,Maybe get in the local paper.
00:53:34:01,00:53:36:06,Maybe my teachers would see it.
00:53:36:10,00:53:37:23,"Okay, get some rest."
00:53:38:15,00:53:41:03,I need you back up on deck as soon as you're able.
00:53:42:10,00:53:43:10,I can't.
00:53:44:03,00:53:45:16,What?
00:53:49:14,00:53:50:22,I can't see.
00:54:50:21,00:54:51:21,Sir.
00:54:53:05,00:54:55:16,The French have been forced back on the western side.
00:54:56:14,00:54:57:23,They're still holding a perimeter?
00:54:58:02,00:54:59:02,For now.
00:55:00:16,00:55:02:22,Officer coming through. Move yourselves. Move yourselves!
00:55:13:17,00:55:15:02,Where are the destroyers?
00:55:15:06,00:55:16:19,There'll be one soon.
00:55:19:22,00:55:20:22,One?
00:55:21:01,00:55:23:15,"After yesterday's losses, it's one ship on the mole at a time."
00:55:23:19,00:55:24:21,The battle is here.
00:55:25:01,00:55:26:14,What the hell are they saving them for?
00:55:26:17,00:55:28:04,The next battle.
00:55:28:08,00:55:29:19,The one for Britain.
00:55:29:23,00:55:31:22,It's the same with the planes.
00:55:34:01,00:55:35:16,But it's right there.
00:55:36:09,00:55:37:09,You can practically—
00:55:37:13,00:55:39:14,"Seeing home doesn't help us get there, Colonel."
00:55:39:18,00:55:41:17,They need to send more ships.
00:55:42:15,00:55:44:05,Every hour the enemy pushes closer.
00:55:45:01,00:55:47:01,They've activated the small vessels pool.
00:55:48:00,00:55:49:00,Small vessels?
00:55:49:04,00:55:51:15,It's the list of civilian boats for requisition.
00:55:52:03,00:55:53:03,Civilian?
00:55:54:23,00:55:56:18,We need destroyers.
00:55:56:21,00:55:58:16,Small boats can load from the beach.
00:55:58:20,00:56:00:02,Not in these conditions.
00:56:00:06,00:56:02:18,"Well, I'd rather face waves than dive bombers."
00:56:05:17,00:56:08:11,"No, you're right. They won't get up in this."
00:56:09:19,00:56:12:14,The Royal Engineers are building piers from lorries.
00:56:12:18,00:56:15:09,At least that should help us when the tide comes back.
00:56:15:13,00:56:17:17,"Well, we'll know in six hours' time."
00:56:18:17,00:56:20:05,I thought the tides were every three?
00:56:21:23,00:56:24:18,"Then it's good that you're army and I'm navy, isn't it?"
00:56:26:05,00:56:28:12,There. Vanquisher.
00:56:43:08,00:56:44:13,Where's the crew?
00:56:44:17,00:56:46:14,Probably got spooked after they ran aground.
00:56:47:09,00:56:48:22,Scarpered up the beach.
00:56:49:09,00:56:50:09,Why?
00:56:50:13,00:56:53:18,'Cause we're outside the perimeter. Enemy could be right there.
00:56:54:22,00:56:57:08,"All right, best shut ourselves inside, boys."
00:56:57:12,00:56:58:12,Wait for the high tide.
00:56:58:16,00:57:00:06,How long's that?
00:57:00:10,00:57:02:01,Every three hours.
00:57:25:15,00:57:27:17,I've put a bit of pressure on it.
00:57:27:21,00:57:29:20,"Strapped him up, made him comfortable."
00:57:31:02,00:57:32:02,What?
00:57:34:10,00:57:35:10,"It's bad, Dad."
00:57:38:10,00:57:39:22,"Well, should we turn back?"
00:57:46:07,00:57:47:07,We've come so far.
00:57:48:16,00:57:50:04,"Dad, is that one of ours?"
00:57:51:17,00:57:55:00,That's a Heinkel. They'll go for that minesweeper there.
00:57:55:12,00:57:57:11,Hang on. Shouldn't we stand by to pick up survivors?
00:57:57:11,00:57:59:08,To do that we have to survive ourselves.
00:58:04:03,00:58:06:07,Poke your head out. See if the water's come in.
00:58:11:18,00:58:13:06,"Talkative sod, aren't you?"
00:58:39:08,00:58:41:03,It's barely come in at all.
00:58:41:07,00:58:43:11,- Fuck's sake. - Calm down.
00:58:43:15,00:58:45:20,"What goes out comes back in again, right?"
00:58:45:24,00:58:47:10,"Yeah, but how long?"
00:59:04:00,00:59:05:00,Spitfires!
00:59:05:21,00:59:06:22,Come on.
00:59:13:13,00:59:14:14,"Come on, come on."
00:59:23:08,00:59:24:16,"Dad, he got him!"
00:59:24:20,00:59:26:11,Yeah! Yeah!
00:59:33:19,00:59:35:08,The Heinkel's moving off.
00:59:40:11,00:59:41:11,Yeah.
00:59:43:02,00:59:44:02,"Oh, no."
00:59:46:01,00:59:47:20,Smoke from the Spitfire!
00:59:49:04,00:59:51:00,Watch for a parachute!
00:59:57:20,00:59:58:20,Oi.
01:00:03:20,01:00:05:12,Oi. Oi.
01:00:51:14,01:00:52:22,Are you German?
01:00:53:02,01:00:54:10,"No, Dutch. Dutch!"
01:00:55:19,01:00:56:19,Merchant navy.
01:00:57:15,01:00:59:03,Here to pick you up. To help you.
01:00:59:07,01:01:00:23,Why'd you leave your boat?
01:01:01:03,01:01:02:09,In case the Germans come.
01:01:02:24,01:01:05:02,We wait up the beach.
01:01:05:06,01:01:06:21,With the soldiers. Wait for the tide.
01:01:07:01,01:01:09:08,You came back. The tide must be in.
01:01:10:12,01:01:12:05,"Coming. Coming, yes."
01:01:12:16,01:01:14:13,But more hours till we float.
01:01:14:20,01:01:15:20,Hours?
01:01:16:00,01:01:17:11,Why'd you come back?
01:01:19:09,01:01:20:13,Not so heavy when I left.
01:01:33:20,01:01:35:10,No 'chute!
01:01:40:11,01:01:41:11,"Best of luck, Collins."
01:01:46:24,01:01:48:21,"Collins, do you read?"
01:02:14:24,01:02:16:01,He's down.
01:02:59:04,01:03:00:04,Dad.
01:03:00:08,01:03:01:13,"Dad, watch the engine."
01:03:02:10,01:03:04:21,"Dad, he's down. There was no 'chute."
01:03:09:04,01:03:10:12,"Dad, come on. There was no 'chute."
01:03:11:12,01:03:12:12,He's probably dead.
01:03:12:16,01:03:14:20,"Damn it, I hear you, Peter! I hear you!"
01:03:18:04,01:03:19:21,He may be alive. Maybe.
01:03:21:22,01:03:23:18,We may be able to help him.
01:04:17:09,01:04:19:15,No! Then they'll know we're in here.
01:04:19:19,01:04:21:07,Why else are they shooting at us?
01:04:21:19,01:04:23:08,Look at the grouping.
01:04:27:04,01:04:28:15,Target practice.
01:05:29:20,01:05:33:06,"Go. Plug it. Go, go."
01:05:53:12,01:05:54:19,We have to plug it.
01:05:54:23,01:05:56:15,"After you, mate."
01:06:18:16,01:06:20:04,You ready? Go!
01:06:24:21,01:06:27:09,How do we get off? Do we need to ditch some ballast?
01:06:27:19,01:06:29:14,Weight! Do we need to lose weight?
01:06:29:18,01:06:31:12,"Weight. Weight, yes."
01:06:31:16,01:06:32:24,Yes.
01:06:33:04,01:06:34:13,Somebody needs to get off.
01:06:35:14,01:06:36:24,Well volunteered.
01:06:37:04,01:06:38:17,We don't need a volunteer.
01:06:39:04,01:06:40:19,I know someone who ought to get off.
01:06:43:06,01:06:44:06,This one.
01:06:45:14,01:06:46:21,He's a German spy.
01:06:47:01,01:06:48:10,Don't be daft.
01:06:48:14,01:06:50:03,He's a fucking Jerry.
01:06:51:00,01:06:53:02,Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?
01:06:54:19,01:06:55:23,'Cause I have.
01:06:56:20,01:06:57:20,He don't speak English.
01:06:58:00,01:07:01:04,If he does it's with an accent that's thicker than sauerkraut sauce.
01:07:01:08,01:07:03:01,You're daft. Tell him.
01:07:03:14,01:07:04:20,Yeah.
01:07:08:05,01:07:10:15,Tell me.
01:07:35:17,01:07:36:23,"Tell me, Gibson."
01:07:45:00,01:07:46:01,Tell me!
01:07:47:03,01:07:48:15,"Tell him, for God's sake!"
01:07:57:11,01:07:59:02,A frog.
01:07:59:13,01:08:01:02,A bloody frog.
01:08:01:20,01:08:04:22,A cowardly little queue-jumping frog.
01:08:05:14,01:08:06:23,"Who's Gibson, eh?"
01:08:07:03,01:08:09:14,"Some naked, dead Englishman lying out on that sand?"
01:08:09:18,01:08:11:19,Did you at least have the decency to bury him?
01:08:12:00,01:08:13:21,He did. I helped him. I thought it was his mate.
01:08:13:23,01:08:15:09,- Maybe he killed him. - He didn't kill him.
01:08:15:09,01:08:16:09,How do we know?
01:08:16:13,01:08:18:23,How hard is it to find a dead Englishman on Dunkirk beach?
01:08:19:03,01:08:20:09,He didn't kill anyone.
01:08:20:13,01:08:23:02,"He was just looking for a way off the sand, like the rest of us."
01:08:28:04,01:08:29:21,Haven't they had enough practice by now?
01:08:30:01,01:08:32:01,They're trying to make sure she won't float.
01:08:32:05,01:08:33:17,Will she still float?
01:08:33:21,01:08:35:16,"Float, yes. Yes, with less weight."
01:08:37:08,01:08:38:12,And we know who's getting off.
01:08:38:13,01:08:40:16,"No, you can't do that. He's French. He's on our side."
01:08:40:20,01:08:42:08,Go on. Up you go.
01:08:42:12,01:08:44:18,"As soon as he pokes his head out, they'll slaughter him."
01:08:44:22,01:08:46:04,Better him than me.
01:08:46:08,01:08:47:12,It's not fair.
01:08:47:16,01:08:48:23,Survival's not fair.
01:08:49:03,01:08:50:03,"No, it's shit."
01:08:51:00,01:08:53:08,"It's fear, and it's greed."
01:08:53:12,01:08:55:12,Fate pushed through the bowels of men.
01:08:55:16,01:08:56:16,Shit.
01:08:58:04,01:08:59:10,He saved our lives.
01:08:59:14,01:09:00:20,And he's about to do it again.
01:09:01:00,01:09:02:01,"No, don't! Stop!"
01:09:03:09,01:09:06:18,"Somebody's gotta get off, so the rest of us can live."
01:09:07:12,01:09:08:13,If you wanna volunteer—
01:09:08:17,01:09:09:22,Fuck no.
01:09:10:04,01:09:11:04,I'm going home.
01:09:11:21,01:09:13:12,And if this is the price?
01:09:18:11,01:09:19:15,I'll live with it.
01:09:20:06,01:09:21:06,But it's wrong.
01:09:22:01,01:09:23:01,Go on!
01:09:25:03,01:09:27:03,One man's not going to make enough difference.
01:09:27:07,01:09:29:16,"You'd best hope it does, because you'd be volunteering next."
01:09:30:13,01:09:31:13,What?
01:09:32:09,01:09:34:07,"We're regimental brothers, mate."
01:09:34:22,01:09:36:07,It's just the way it is.
01:09:46:07,01:09:47:16,We float!
01:09:48:09,01:09:49:12,We float!
01:09:50:05,01:09:51:20,Start the bloody engine!
01:10:30:04,01:10:31:14,Afternoon.
01:11:26:23,01:11:29:08,"I'm sorry, son. I really don't know."
01:11:31:24,01:11:33:18,You're right not moving him.
01:11:37:08,01:11:38:20,You've done the best for him you can.
01:11:50:22,01:11:52:02,We've wasted the day.
01:11:52:06,01:11:54:07,"I share your frustration, Colonel."
01:11:55:20,01:11:56:21,Johnny!
01:12:03:20,01:12:05:18,"Grounded trawler, taking fire."
01:12:05:22,01:12:07:23,They're breaking through the dunes to the east.
01:12:11:18,01:12:13:04,This is it.
01:12:21:06,01:12:22:08,Plug the holes!
01:12:22:12,01:12:23:19,With what?
01:12:34:17,01:12:36:14,Plug the holes!
01:12:38:09,01:12:41:04,Other side! Other side!
01:13:30:23,01:13:32:10,What do you see?
01:13:39:07,01:13:40:15,Home.
01:15:35:05,01:15:37:05,Is he all right? The boy?
01:15:39:05,01:15:40:11,No.
01:15:40:15,01:15:42:07,"No, he's not."
01:15:53:17,01:15:54:17,Dad!
01:16:02:14,01:16:04:21,"Come on. Come on, Farrier. Come on."
01:16:23:21,01:16:25:11,There's men in the water!
01:17:10:19,01:17:11:19,Oil.
01:17:13:06,01:17:15:18,It's oil. Oil. You're getting into oil!
01:17:51:05,01:17:52:16,Keep coming.
01:17:53:14,01:17:55:00,Plenty of room.
01:18:00:01,01:18:01:20,"All right, below deck."
01:18:37:22,01:18:39:19,Abandon ship!
01:19:02:02,01:19:04:09,Gibson! Leave it!
01:19:47:09,01:19:48:13,Below decks.
01:20:37:11,01:20:39:16,"Listen, we have to get as many of you on board as we can"
01:20:39:19,01:20:40:23,before that oil catches fire.
01:20:41:02,01:20:43:17,You go below decks or you get off my boat. That's your choice.
01:20:46:15,01:20:48:09,Keep coming.
01:20:49:17,01:20:52:05,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Careful! Careful down there!
01:20:52:09,01:20:53:16,Careful! Careful down there!
01:20:55:17,01:20:57:20,"He's dead, mate."
01:21:02:11,01:21:04:14,So be bloody careful with him.
01:21:26:14,01:21:28:06,"Um, will he be okay?"
01:21:29:00,01:21:30:02,The boy?
01:21:36:01,01:21:37:01,Yeah.
01:23:00:19,01:23:02:13,He's coming back round.
01:23:03:11,01:23:04:18,He's coming back round!
01:23:10:15,01:23:12:13,"Come on, Farrier. Come on."
01:23:27:18,01:23:29:00,Get off the ship!
01:23:45:05,01:23:46:16,"Come on, Farrier. Get around them."
01:23:46:20,01:23:48:03,"Come on, come on."
01:24:44:19,01:24:45:19,Go.
01:24:50:07,01:24:51:07,Go! Go! Go!
01:25:05:16,01:25:06:18,Go!
01:25:40:13,01:25:41:13,Easy.
01:25:46:16,01:25:47:22,Take me home.
01:26:45:20,01:26:47:03,Where are you from?
01:26:48:01,01:26:49:20,Out of Dartmouth!
01:26:49:24,01:26:51:06,Christ.
01:26:52:08,01:26:53:16,You from Deal?
01:26:53:20,01:26:55:07,I am!
01:26:55:11,01:26:57:15,You watch the current at the mouth!
01:26:57:19,01:26:58:19,Aye.
01:26:58:23,01:27:00:01,And thank you!
01:27:49:20,01:27:50:21,That's a fighter.
01:27:51:01,01:27:52:05,"Yes, an Me 109."
01:27:52:09,01:27:54:02,"From the south. Peter, you take the tiller."
01:27:54:13,01:27:56:10,Listen for my instructions.
01:27:57:06,01:27:58:11,Point her south!
01:28:11:02,01:28:12:02,"Full speed, Peter."
01:28:14:12,01:28:15:23,Keep coming round.
01:28:16:03,01:28:17:08,Keep coming.
01:28:18:16,01:28:22:08,"Before he fires, he's gotta drop his nose. I'll give you the signal."
01:28:23:20,01:28:25:01,#NAME?
01:28:26:06,01:28:28:07,Wait for him to commit to his line.
01:28:45:13,01:28:46:14,Now!
01:29:24:19,01:29:25:19,He's gone.
01:29:25:22,01:29:27:06,"Yeah, bigger fish to fry."
01:29:27:10,01:29:29:07,"How'd you know that stuff, anyway?"
01:29:29:17,01:29:30:22,My son's one of you lot.
01:29:31:17,01:29:33:10,I knew he'd see us through.
01:29:39:11,01:29:40:11,You're RAF?
01:29:42:12,01:29:44:09,No. Not me.
01:29:44:13,01:29:47:21,My brother. He flew Hurricanes.
01:29:48:01,01:29:49:15,Died third week into the war.
01:30:29:21,01:30:31:23,"No, stay downstairs, please."
01:30:32:14,01:30:34:14,We just wanna see the cliffs.
01:30:41:12,01:30:43:11,#NAME?
01:30:44:01,01:30:45:11,That's Dorset.
01:30:46:01,01:30:47:14,But it's home.
01:30:49:14,01:30:52:01,"We let you all down, didn't we?"
01:31:31:09,01:31:34:06,"Christ, how many you got in there?"
01:31:52:06,01:31:53:21,Make your way to the trains.
01:31:55:13,01:31:57:03,Where the hell were you?
01:32:04:13,01:32:06:07,They know where you were.
01:32:11:13,01:32:12:13,Bye.
01:32:32:08,01:32:33:17,Cup of tea?
01:32:35:15,01:32:37:00,Cup of tea?
01:32:37:20,01:32:40:14,Well done. Well done.
01:32:41:00,01:32:42:03,"Well done, lads."
01:32:42:07,01:32:44:22,"Well done. Well done, lads."
01:32:46:00,01:32:47:15,Well done.
01:32:48:05,01:32:49:21,All we did is survive.
01:32:50:13,01:32:51:23,That's enough.
01:32:59:17,01:33:00:17,Well done.
01:33:01:21,01:33:03:04,Well done.
01:33:14:08,01:33:16:19,That old bloke wouldn't even look us in the eye.
01:33:37:04,01:33:39:02,"Come on, private!"
01:33:39:24,01:33:44:14,"I know we're officers, but it's us or the enemy."
01:33:45:16,01:33:47:24,So now is not the time to be particular.
01:33:51:15,01:33:54:06,"Well, Churchill got his 30,000."
01:33:54:10,01:33:55:17,And then some.
01:33:56:14,01:33:58:16,"Almost 300,000."
01:34:02:02,01:34:03:08,So far.
01:34:04:17,01:34:05:18,So far?
01:34:06:07,01:34:07:13,I'm staying.
01:34:08:17,01:34:10:02,For the French.
01:35:03:18,01:35:05:03,Hey!
01:35:05:07,01:35:06:11,Where are we?

01:35:11:05,01:35:12:17,Woking.
01:35:13:08,01:35:14:23,Grab me one of them papers.
01:35:15:05,01:35:16:08,Go on!
01:35:30:04,01:35:31:14,Can't bear it.
01:35:33:10,01:35:34:15,You read it.
01:35:35:10,01:35:36:10,Can't bear it?
01:35:37:01,01:35:39:06,They'll be spitting at us in the streets.
