00:01:00:08,00:01:03:14,I knew Harvey Dent.
00:01:04:08,00:01:05:22,I was his friend.
00:01:08:03,00:01:14:06,And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did.
00:01:16:12,00:01:18:14,I believed in Harvey Dent.
00:01:37:14,00:01:40:11,"Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA."
00:01:40:14,00:01:41:16,He wasn't alone.
00:01:41:19,00:01:45:21,"- Uh, you don't get to bring friends. - They are not my friends."
00:01:46:01,00:01:48:01,"Don't worry, no charge for them."
00:01:48:07,00:01:51:24,#NAME?
00:01:52:06,00:01:53:20,They work for the mercenary.
00:01:54:09,00:01:55:21,The masked man.
00:01:56:13,00:01:58:22,#NAME?
00:01:59:15,00:02:01:16,Get them on board. I'll call it in.
00:02:10:06,00:02:12:14,The flight plan I just filed with the agency...
00:02:12:18,00:02:16:23,"...lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here..."
00:02:17:03,00:02:19:09,...but only one of you!
00:02:21:22,00:02:26:16,First one to talk gets to stay on my aircraft!
00:02:33:14,00:02:37:06,Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?
00:02:39:18,00:02:41:03,
00:02:42:01,00:02:44:09,He didn't fly so good!
00:02:44:13,00:02:46:13,Who wants to try next?
00:02:47:12,00:02:49:03,Tell me about Bane!
00:02:49:07,00:02:50:19,Why does he wear the mask?
00:02:53:14,00:02:55:23,A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!
00:02:56:03,00:02:59:19,"Well, perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man..."
00:02:59:23,00:03:03:02,...before throwing him out of a plane.
00:03:07:01,00:03:08:19,At least you can talk.
00:03:08:23,00:03:10:02,Who are you?
00:03:10:06,00:03:12:17,It doesn't matter who we are.
00:03:13:04,00:03:15:08,What matters is our plan.
00:03:21:16,00:03:25:02,No one cared who I was till I put on the mask.
00:03:26:16,00:03:28:16,"If I pull that off, will you die?"
00:03:28:20,00:03:31:00,It would be extremely painful.
00:03:31:07,00:03:32:08,You're a big guy.
00:03:32:12,00:03:33:17,For you.
00:03:37:15,00:03:39:21,Was getting caught part of your plan?
00:03:40:04,00:03:41:13,Of course.
00:03:46:12,00:03:50:01,Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours.
00:03:50:05,00:03:53:17,#NAME?
00:04:07:02,00:04:10:15,"Well, congratulations, you got yourself caught!"
00:04:10:19,00:04:14:05,- Sir? - Now what's the next step of your master plan?
00:04:15:02,00:04:16:19,Crashing this plane...
00:04:22:03,00:04:23:15,...with no survivors.
00:04:23:19,00:04:25:13,
00:04:46:24,00:04:48:01,"Mayday, Mayday!"
00:04:48:05,00:04:49:10,
00:04:55:13,00:04:57:04,
00:05:34:07,00:05:37:11,Aah! What you doing to me? Let me out!
00:05:40:12,00:05:41:19,No!
00:05:42:09,00:05:44:02,"No, no, no! No!"
00:05:51:05,00:05:52:23,
00:05:55:21,00:05:58:14,"No! They expect one of us in the wreckage, brother."
00:06:00:18,00:06:02:05,Have we started the fire?
00:06:02:11,00:06:05:23,"Yes, the fire rises."
00:06:07:15,00:06:09:09,
00:06:14:21,00:06:18:11,"Calm down, doctor. Now is not the time for fear."
00:06:19:04,00:06:20:20,That comes later.
00:06:47:12,00:06:51:06,Harvey Dent Day may not be our oldest public holiday...
00:06:51:10,00:06:54:11,...but we're here tonight because it's one of the most important.
00:06:54:15,00:06:58:18,Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand against organized crime...
00:06:58:22,00:07:03:01,"...had made Gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death, eight years ago."
00:07:03:05,00:07:06:09,This city has seen a historic turnaround.
00:07:06:14,00:07:11:21,"No city is without crime, but this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act..."
00:07:12:01,00:07:15:07,...gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob.
00:07:15:10,00:07:19:03,Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act...
00:07:19:07,00:07:22:07,"...and to them I say, ""Not on my watch."""
00:07:22:11,00:07:23:15,
00:07:23:19,00:07:26:13,I want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event.
00:07:26:17,00:07:30:20,I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight. I'm sure he's with us in spirit.
00:07:30:24,00:07:33:18,And now I'm gonna give way to an important voice...
00:07:33:22,00:07:36:09,You ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things?
00:07:36:13,00:07:38:06,No one has. Not in years.
00:07:38:10,00:07:42:07,... people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape.
00:07:42:11,00:07:46:00,A thug who showed his true nature...
00:07:46:04,00:07:48:15,...when he betrayed the trust of this great man...
00:07:49:17,00:07:51:07,...and murdered him in cold blood.
00:07:52:00,00:07:54:09,"Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow."
00:07:54:13,00:07:56:13,#NAME?
00:07:56:17,00:08:00:05,Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. I'll let him tell you himself.
00:08:00:09,00:08:01:20,Commissioner Gordon.
00:08:11:04,00:08:12:15,The truth?
00:08:17:12,00:08:18:20,I have...
00:08:20:03,00:08:21:18,...written a speech...
00:08:22:23,00:08:25:18,...telling the truth about Harvey Dent.
00:08:30:17,00:08:32:21,Maybe the time isn't right.
00:08:36:16,00:08:39:07,Maybe right now...
00:08:39:10,00:08:42:02,...all you need to know is that there are...
00:08:42:18,00:08:47:01,...1000 inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act.
00:08:47:05,00:08:52:03,"These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized-crime machine."
00:08:52:08,00:08:57:05,"Maybe, for now, all I should say about the death of Harvey Dent is this:"
00:09:01:12,00:09:02:17,It has not been for nothing.
00:09:03:17,00:09:04:19,
00:09:04:23,00:09:07:17,#NAME?
00:09:07:21,00:09:10:20,- ...he never leaves the east wing. - I heard he had an accident.
00:09:11:00,00:09:14:18,"- Yeah, that he's disfigured. He has to wear a... - Mr. Till?"
00:09:15:01,00:09:18:16,Why are your people using the main staircase?
00:09:19:05,00:09:21:04,And where's Mrs. Bolton?
00:09:22:00,00:09:24:01,"Uh, she's at the bar, sir. Can I help?"
00:09:24:05,00:09:25:10,The east drawing room.
00:09:25:14,00:09:30:14,"Unlock the door, put the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more."
00:09:34:15,00:09:36:24,"I'm sorry, Miss Tate. I tried, but he won't see you."
00:09:37:09,00:09:39:04,And you mustn't take it personally.
00:09:39:12,00:09:43:08,Everyone knows that Wayne's holed up in there with 8-inch nails...
00:09:43:12,00:09:45:04,...peeing into Mason jars.
00:09:45:08,00:09:47:17,It's very good of you to let me on the grounds.
00:10:00:01,00:10:03:10,Why are you wasting your time trying to talk to a man...
00:10:03:13,00:10:08:07,...who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project?
00:10:08:11,00:10:10:17,He can't get your money back. I can.
00:10:11:12,00:10:15:21,"I could try explaining that a save-the-world project, vain or not..."
00:10:16:01,00:10:18:11,"...is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett."
00:10:18:15,00:10:21:19,But you understand only money and the power you think it buys...
00:10:21:24,00:10:24:22,...so why waste my time indeed?
00:10:25:11,00:10:26:23,Second shift reports in?
00:10:27:03,00:10:29:05,You should spend more time with the mayor.
00:10:29:09,00:10:31:06,"Well, that's your department."
00:10:32:06,00:10:34:01,Anyone shown him the crime stats?
00:10:34:05,00:10:37:12,"He goes by his gut and it bothers him, no matter what the numbers."
00:10:37:16,00:10:41:13,#NAME?
00:10:41:17,00:10:45:23,He'll have plenty of time for visits. The mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.
00:10:46:02,00:10:47:16,#NAME?
00:10:47:20,00:10:51:17,- But he's a hero. - A war hero. This is peacetime.
00:11:20:11,00:11:21:12,
00:11:21:20,00:11:25:05,"Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne."
00:11:27:16,00:11:29:09,"It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?"
00:11:31:03,00:11:37:05,"Although you don't have the long nails or, heh, the facial scars, sir."
00:11:38:02,00:11:40:05,Is that what they say about me?
00:11:40:14,00:11:43:11,It's just that no one ever sees you.
00:11:43:23,00:11:47:20,That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of one that belonged to my mother.
00:11:47:24,00:11:51:02,It can't be the same one...
00:11:51:14,00:11:54:18,...because her pearls are in this safe...
00:11:56:01,00:11:59:02,...the manufacturer clearly explained...
00:12:01:21,00:12:03:15,...is uncrackable.
00:12:08:21,00:12:10:15,Oops.
00:12:10:19,00:12:12:24,Nobody told me it was uncrackable.
00:12:14:17,00:12:17:04,I'm afraid I can't let you take those.
00:12:17:19,00:12:21:07,"Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman any more than I would beat up a cripple."
00:12:22:20,00:12:26:04,"Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made."
00:12:31:17,00:12:33:12,"Good night, Mr. Wayne."
00:12:48:16,00:12:50:01,Can I have a ride?
00:12:50:13,00:12:51:18,You read my mind.
00:12:52:13,00:12:54:02,Let's go.
00:12:55:02,00:12:56:21,Miss Tate was asking to see you again.
00:12:57:01,00:12:58:16,She's very persistent.
00:12:58:20,00:13:01:04,"And quite lovely, in case you were wondering."
00:13:01:08,00:13:03:12,- I wasn't. - What are you doing?
00:13:03:16,00:13:06:23,Examining print dust. We've been robbed.
00:13:07:03,00:13:10:02,"And this is your idea of, uh, sounding the alarm, is it?"
00:13:10:06,00:13:12:10,"She took the pearls, tracking device and all."
00:13:12:14,00:13:13:21,#NAME?
00:13:14:01,00:13:16:16,Perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house.
00:13:16:20,00:13:19:07,Perhaps you should start learning to make your own bed.
00:13:20:13,00:13:23:09,- Why were you dusting for prints? - I wasn't.
00:13:24:06,00:13:25:18,She was.
00:13:29:00,00:13:32:02,Sir. Congressman Gilly's wife has been calling in.
00:13:32:05,00:13:36:03,The congressman never made it home after the Wayne Foundation event.
00:13:36:19,00:13:38:11,That's a job for the police?
00:13:38:15,00:13:41:11,"When you and Dent cleaned the streets, you cleaned them good."
00:13:41:15,00:13:45:10,"Pretty soon we'll be chasing down, uh, overdue library books."
00:13:45:14,00:13:46:24,
00:13:47:04,00:13:51:08,"And yet here you are, like we're still at war."
00:13:53:07,00:13:55:13,"- What's your name, son? - Blake, sir."
00:13:55:17,00:13:57:12,You have something you want to ask me?
00:13:59:18,00:14:03:02,"It's about that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died."
00:14:03:06,00:14:05:05,The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.
00:14:05:16,00:14:08:11,"He murders those people, takes down two SWAT teams..."
00:14:08:15,00:14:12:09,...breaks Dent's neck and then just vanishes?
00:14:12:20,00:14:15:05,"I'm not hearing a question, son."
00:14:15:09,00:14:17:08,Don't you want to know who he was?
00:14:18:05,00:14:20:15,I know exactly who he was.
00:14:22:19,00:14:24:14,He was the Batman.
00:14:25:05,00:14:26:15,
00:14:26:19,00:14:29:13,Let's go see about the congressman's wife.
00:14:38:09,00:14:39:20,Master Wayne?
00:14:41:15,00:14:43:14,Master Wayne?
00:15:14:11,00:15:16:20,You haven't been down here in a long time.
00:15:16:24,00:15:20:13,Trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints.
00:15:20:19,00:15:22:12,Unless she's lost a lot of weight...
00:15:23:19,00:15:26:03,...she was wearing someone else's fingerprints.
00:15:26:07,00:15:27:10,She's good.
00:15:27:14,00:15:31:03,"She may be, but we have a trace on the necklace."
00:15:31:07,00:15:33:22,We do. I cross-referenced the address she went back to...
00:15:34:02,00:15:37:17,"...with police data on high-end B-and-E's, and, um..."
00:15:38:04,00:15:39:23,Selina Kyle.
00:15:40:03,00:15:44:23,"The databases are full of close-calls, tips from fences."
00:15:45:03,00:15:49:03,"She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet."
00:15:49:07,00:15:52:01,We should send the police before she fences the pearls.
00:15:52:05,00:15:54:10,She won't. She likes them too much.
00:15:54:14,00:15:56:09,And they weren't what she was after.
00:15:56:13,00:15:58:15,#NAME?
00:15:58:19,00:16:01:19,It was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe.
00:16:01:23,00:16:04:13,It gives a good pull and it's untraceable.
00:16:04:17,00:16:07:13,Fascinating. You two should exchange notes over coffee.
00:16:07:17,00:16:10:00,You're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?
00:16:10:04,00:16:14:16,"At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee, if it brought you back to the world."
00:16:14:19,00:16:17:01,There's nothing out there for me.
00:16:17:07,00:16:18:19,And that's the problem.
00:16:18:23,00:16:21:13,You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn't move on.
00:16:21:17,00:16:23:24,You never went to find a life. To find someone.
00:16:24:04,00:16:25:13,Alfred...
00:16:26:13,00:16:28:08,...I did find someone.
00:16:28:12,00:16:29:22,"I know, and you lost them."
00:16:30:02,00:16:32:01,"But that's all part of living, sir."
00:16:32:05,00:16:36:08,"But you're not living, you're just waiting, hoping for things to go bad again."
00:16:36:13,00:16:38:00,Remember when you left Gotham?
00:16:38:04,00:16:41:04,"Before all this, before Batman?"
00:16:41:22,00:16:42:23,You were gone seven year.
00:16:43:03,00:16:47:17,"Seven years I waited, hoping that you wouldn't come back."
00:16:47:21,00:16:51:12,"Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence."
00:16:51:16,00:16:53:22,There's this café on the banks of the Arno.
00:16:54:02,00:16:57:08,Every fine evening I'd sit there and order a Fernet Branca.
00:16:58:04,00:17:00:10,I had this fantasy...
00:17:01:12,00:17:04:05,...that I would look across the tables...
00:17:04:21,00:17:08:08,"...and I'd see you there, with a wife."
00:17:08:13,00:17:10:08,Maybe a couple of kids.
00:17:12:10,00:17:16:07,"You wouldn't say anything to me, nor me to you."
00:17:17:14,00:17:21:07,But we'd both know that you'd made it.
00:17:22:05,00:17:23:19,That you were happy.
00:17:26:16,00:17:30:09,I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.
00:17:31:13,00:17:36:01,"I always knew there was nothing here for you, except pain and tragedy."
00:17:36:05,00:17:39:02,And I wanted something more for you than that.
00:17:44:03,00:17:45:11,I still do.
00:17:49:17,00:17:52:13,They wash up here a couple of times a month.
00:17:52:17,00:17:54:04,More when it gets colder.
00:17:54:08,00:17:56:07,"Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels."
00:17:57:23,00:18:02:02,"We pulled him from the basin, but other than that we didn't touch him."
00:18:04:11,00:18:06:02,- What? - Name's Jimmy.
00:18:06:06,00:18:07:16,He's from St. Swithin's.
00:18:08:07,00:18:12:05,It's the boys' home where I coach some ball.
00:18:15:00,00:18:16:17,Jimmy hadn't been around for months.
00:18:16:21,00:18:19:09,#NAME?
00:18:19:13,00:18:23:10,He aged out. We don't have the resources to keep boys on after 16.
00:18:23:13,00:18:25:16,I thought the Wayne Foundation gave money for that.
00:18:25:19,00:18:27:22,Not for the past couple of years.
00:18:28:02,00:18:31:22,"- He has a brother here, doesn't he? - Mark. I'll tell him."
00:18:32:02,00:18:35:02,"I'd like to, if that's all right."
00:18:36:05,00:18:38:07,You know what he was doing in the tunnels?
00:18:38:11,00:18:42:07,Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out.
00:18:44:14,00:18:46:16,Say you can live down there.
00:18:47:08,00:18:48:21,Say there's work down there.
00:18:49:01,00:18:50:13,Work?
00:18:50:20,00:18:53:12,What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers?
00:18:53:16,00:18:56:07,"More than you can find up here, I guess."
00:18:57:04,00:18:58:10,So you know about him?
00:18:58:14,00:18:59:20,Of course.
00:19:01:13,00:19:03:09,Do you think he's coming back?
00:19:05:13,00:19:06:21,I don't know.
00:19:20:14,00:19:22:06,You brought a date?
00:19:22:10,00:19:25:15,I like having someone around to open doors for me.
00:19:26:22,00:19:29:18,Right hand. No partials.
00:19:33:16,00:19:36:03,#NAME?
00:19:36:23,00:19:39:00,"Not so fast, handsome."
00:19:39:07,00:19:40:13,You got something for me?
00:19:42:03,00:19:43:15,"Ah, yes."
00:19:49:16,00:19:51:02,
00:19:53:05,00:19:56:08,I don't know what you're planning to do with Mr. Wayne's prints...
00:19:56:12,00:19:59:07,...but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.
00:20:00:02,00:20:02:04,"You don't count so good, huh?"
00:20:02:08,00:20:03:14,I count fine.
00:20:03:24,00:20:07:04,"In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now."
00:20:09:15,00:20:10:16,Okay.
00:20:14:19,00:20:17:11,"My friend's outside. Just hit ""send."""
00:20:21:18,00:20:22:23,
00:20:29:05,00:20:30:14,This place is a little dead.
00:20:30:18,00:20:33:24,It'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.
00:20:35:14,00:20:36:17,Is everything okay?
00:20:36:21,00:20:38:21,Great. Catch you later.
00:20:42:07,00:20:43:09,
00:20:43:13,00:20:44:21,Hmm.
00:20:45:13,00:20:47:21,It would have been a lot easier...
00:20:48:08,00:20:50:06,...to just give me what we agreed.
00:20:50:11,00:20:52:20,We can't have loose ends.
00:20:53:02,00:20:56:20,"And even in that dress, no one's gonna miss you."
00:20:57:00,00:20:58:12,No.
00:20:58:16,00:21:00:13,But my friend over there?
00:21:00:17,00:21:03:21,Every cop in the city's missing him.
00:21:04:01,00:21:05:10,That's cute.
00:21:05:13,00:21:08:07,But they're not gonna be looking in a place like this.
00:21:08:14,00:21:11:08,I don't know. You did just use his cell phone.
00:21:14:13,00:21:16:09,
00:21:21:14,00:21:22:23,- Go! - Go!
00:21:39:06,00:21:40:22,Police! Get down now!
00:21:41:14,00:21:43:01,
00:21:44:05,00:21:45:08,Help me! Help me!
00:21:45:12,00:21:47:13,"Help me, please! Please help me!"
00:21:49:04,00:21:51:03,
00:21:51:06,00:21:52:23,
00:21:58:01,00:22:00:09,"Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart."
00:22:02:23,00:22:04:02,Call me?
00:22:07:02,00:22:09:08,"- You okay, miss? - He's bleeding. You gotta help him."
00:22:14:15,00:22:15:17,I got the congressman.
00:22:33:11,00:22:35:16,
00:22:44:16,00:22:45:23,Clear!
00:22:50:02,00:22:54:01,Manhole! Get this up! Get the DWP down here!
00:22:54:24,00:22:56:13,"You three, down with me."
00:22:56:17,00:23:00:03,"You two, you go down, cover the next exit!"
00:23:16:19,00:23:18:04,"What, they went down there?"
00:23:43:04,00:23:44:10,
00:23:49:14,00:23:52:18,"- We're gonna go down there, right? - That was a gas explosion, kid."
00:23:52:22,00:23:56:04,- Wasn't gas. It's a sewer. - No one goes in till we know what's there.
00:23:56:08,00:23:58:05,"We know, sir. The police commissioner."
00:23:58:08,00:24:00:05,Someone get this hothead out of here?
00:24:00:09,00:24:02:21,And where's that DWP guy?
00:24:45:12,00:24:47:11,Why are you here?
00:24:48:01,00:24:49:02,
00:24:49:06,00:24:50:19,Answer him.
00:24:52:11,00:24:54:09,I was asking you.
00:24:54:18,00:24:56:07,It's the police commissioner.
00:25:00:02,00:25:02:13,And you brought him down here?
00:25:03:05,00:25:05:19,- We didn't know what to do - You panicked.
00:25:06:08,00:25:09:07,And your weakness has cost the lives of three others.
00:25:09:11,00:25:10:14,"No, he's alone."
00:25:12:10,00:25:13:20,
00:25:14:11,00:25:16:00,Search him.
00:25:16:04,00:25:17:17,Then I will kill you.
00:25:37:17,00:25:39:07,
00:25:47:06,00:25:50:04,- He's dead - So show me his body.
00:25:50:08,00:25:53:18,The water runs to any one of the outflows. We'd never find him.
00:25:59:19,00:26:01:24,- Follow him! - Follow him?
00:26:02:03,00:26:03:05,
00:26:17:18,00:26:19:13,You okay? You okay?
00:26:19:17,00:26:21:15,"Hey, hey, you awake?"
00:26:21:19,00:26:23:08,
00:26:24:17,00:26:25:18,
00:26:28:06,00:26:29:21,I need to see Bruce Wayne.
00:26:30:01,00:26:32:12,"I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take unscheduled calls."
00:26:32:16,00:26:34:11,Even from a police officer.
00:26:34:15,00:26:38:07,And if I go get a warrant for the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?
00:26:38:11,00:26:40:17,That still count as unscheduled?
00:26:44:20,00:26:46:22,"What can I do for you, officer?"
00:26:47:06,00:26:49:08,Commissioner Gordon's been shot.
00:26:51:16,00:26:53:17,He chased a gunman down into the sewers.
00:26:53:21,00:26:57:05,"When I pulled him out, he was babbling about an underground army."
00:26:57:09,00:26:59:05,A masked man called Bane.
00:27:00:01,00:27:02:09,Shouldn't you be telling your superior officers?
00:27:02:13,00:27:05:15,They asked me if he saw any giant alligators.
00:27:06:02,00:27:07:19,He needs you.
00:27:09:09,00:27:10:16,He needs the Batman.
00:27:12:10,00:27:16:05,"- If Commissioner Gordon thinks... - Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are."
00:27:17:00,00:27:18:23,But we've met before.
00:27:20:02,00:27:24:05,"It was a long time ago. I was a kid. Uh, St. Swithin's."
00:27:24:21,00:27:28:15,It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.
00:27:29:14,00:27:33:17,"My mom died when I was small. It was a car accident, I don't really remember it."
00:27:34:08,00:27:39:12,But my dad got shot a couple years later over a gambling debt...
00:27:39:18,00:27:42:24,...and I remember that one just fine.
00:27:44:08,00:27:47:06,"Not a lot of people know what it feels like, do they?"
00:27:47:15,00:27:49:09,To be angry...
00:27:50:03,00:27:51:23,...in your bones.
00:27:54:12,00:27:56:16,"I mean, they understand."
00:27:57:06,00:27:58:16,Foster parents.
00:27:58:20,00:28:00:20,Everybody understands...
00:28:01:03,00:28:02:15,...for a while.
00:28:03:09,00:28:07:03,And then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can't do.
00:28:07:16,00:28:08:19,Move on.
00:28:09:08,00:28:11:08,"So after a while, they stop understanding."
00:28:11:12,00:28:13:09,They send the angry kid to a boys' home.
00:28:13:18,00:28:17:13,I figured it out too late. You gotta learn to hide the anger.
00:28:18:06,00:28:20:14,Practice smiling in a mirror.
00:28:22:10,00:28:23:22,It's like putting on a mask.
00:28:25:04,00:28:28:17,"So you showed up this one day, in a cool car."
00:28:28:21,00:28:30:17,Pretty girl on your arm.
00:28:31:19,00:28:33:14,We were so excited.
00:28:33:21,00:28:36:11,"Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan."
00:28:36:22,00:28:40:16,"I mean, we used to make up stories about you, man. Legends."
00:28:40:20,00:28:44:15,"And, you know, with the other kids, that's all it was, just stories, but..."
00:28:46:06,00:28:48:12,"Right when I saw you, I knew who you really were."
00:28:49:23,00:28:52:19,I'd seen that look on your face before.
00:28:53:20,00:28:55:23,It's the same one I taught myself.
00:28:57:22,00:29:00:19,I don't know why you took the fall for Dent's murder...
00:29:01:16,00:29:03:17,...but I'm still a believer in the Batman...
00:29:04:13,00:29:06:05,...even if you're not.
00:29:08:22,00:29:13:20,Why did you say that your boys' home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?
00:29:14:00,00:29:15:18,Because the money stopped.
00:29:15:22,00:29:20:03,Might be time to get some fresh air. Start paying attention to the details.
00:29:21:00,00:29:23:09,Some of those details might need your help.
00:29:25:04,00:29:26:13,You check that name? Bane?
00:29:26:16,00:29:29:09,He's a mercenary. No other known names.
00:29:29:12,00:29:31:24,Him and his men were behind a coup in West Africa...
00:29:32:03,00:29:36:16,...that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett.
00:29:37:09,00:29:40:04,- Now Daggett's brought them here. - Or so it seems.
00:29:42:06,00:29:44:09,- I'll keep digging. - Yeah.
00:29:45:14,00:29:51:19,"Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys' homes in the city?"
00:29:51:23,00:29:57:01,The foundation is funded by the profits of Wayne Enterprises.
00:29:57:09,00:29:58:22,There have to be some.
00:29:59:02,00:30:02:10,"- Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think. - I'll get him on the phone."
00:30:02:14,00:30:06:14,"No, no, no. Do we still have any cars around the place?"
00:30:06:18,00:30:08:15,Yes. One or two.
00:30:08:19,00:30:10:19,I need an appointment at the hospital for my leg.
00:30:10:23,00:30:13:17,- Which hospital? - Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.
00:30:18:03,00:30:20:22,- I have seen worse cartilage in knees - That's good.
00:30:21:02,00:30:23:14,No. That's because there is no cartilage in your knee.
00:30:23:18,00:30:27:02,And not much of any use in your elbows or your shoulders.
00:30:27:06,00:30:29:15,Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys...
00:30:29:19,00:30:32:11,...the residual concussive damage to your brain tissue...
00:30:32:15,00:30:35:07,...and the general scarred-over quality of your body...
00:30:35:11,00:30:38:09,...I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing. - Right.
00:30:53:20,00:30:56:09,We were in this together...
00:30:58:12,00:31:00:01,...then you were gone.
00:31:00:05,00:31:02:08,The Batman wasn't needed any more.
00:31:02:12,00:31:05:15,#NAME?
00:31:07:02,00:31:13:03,And now there's evil rising from where we tried to bury it.
00:31:13:08,00:31:17:19,The Batman has to come back.
00:31:17:23,00:31:20:10,What if he doesn't exist any more?
00:31:20:14,00:31:24:01,He must.
00:31:37:18,00:31:39:15,"You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?"
00:31:39:19,00:31:42:16,"- You f... You took my wallet! - No, I..."
00:31:43:09,00:31:45:14,- Get out - She took my... Ah!
00:31:45:18,00:31:48:08,- Now! - Creep!
00:31:48:12,00:31:51:10,I don't know what he's so upset about. There's only 60 bucks in here.
00:31:51:14,00:31:53:08,Probably the watch.
00:31:53:18,00:31:55:08,
00:32:05:00,00:32:06:15,
00:32:08:14,00:32:09:15,Who's that?
00:32:09:19,00:32:11:22,A stiff can barely climb out of his sports car.
00:32:12:02,00:32:14:05,"- No, that's Bruce Wayne! - Mr. Wayne, over here!"
00:32:14:09,00:32:15:19,
00:32:15:23,00:32:18:05,
00:32:19:06,00:32:21:16,- I'm not sure if my assistant... - Right through here.
00:32:21:20,00:32:23:08,Thank you so much.
00:32:23:14,00:32:25:16,
00:32:28:14,00:32:32:09,Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.
00:32:33:10,00:32:35:07,"Miss Tate, isn't it?"
00:32:36:07,00:32:39:08,"Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things."
00:32:39:19,00:32:43:04,The proceeds go to the big fat spread. It's not about charity.
00:32:43:08,00:32:47:16,It's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid this on.
00:32:48:04,00:32:50:14,"Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne."
00:32:50:21,00:32:52:10,Oh.
00:32:52:19,00:32:57:22,"And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself."
00:32:58:08,00:32:59:17,That's very generous of you.
00:32:59:23,00:33:03:20,You have to invest if you want to restore balance to the world.
00:33:03:24,00:33:05:18,Take our clean-energy project.
00:33:06:07,00:33:08:22,Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off.
00:33:09:17,00:33:13:09,"- I'm sorry. - You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne."
00:33:13:13,00:33:18:16,But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.
00:33:19:16,00:33:22:16,And isn't so wounded when it fails...
00:33:23:02,00:33:24:17,...that he goes into hiding.
00:33:26:04,00:33:28:06,"Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne."
00:33:32:07,00:33:33:23,Mind if I cut in?
00:33:35:01,00:33:36:22,Thank you.
00:33:38:11,00:33:39:13,
00:33:39:18,00:33:42:23,- You don't seem happy to see me. - You were supposed to be a shut-in.
00:33:43:02,00:33:44:24,I felt like some fresh air.
00:33:45:19,00:33:47:22,Why didn't you call the police?
00:33:48:06,00:33:50:22,I have a powerful friend who deals with things like this.
00:33:51:02,00:33:55:09,That's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.
00:33:55:22,00:33:58:12,Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
00:33:58:16,00:34:01:09,"Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire."
00:34:02:11,00:34:04:11,- Who's your date? - His wife's in Ibiza.
00:34:04:15,00:34:08:10,"She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried they might get stolen."
00:34:08:14,00:34:10:15,"It's pronounced ""Ibiza."""
00:34:11:05,00:34:14:21,"You wouldn't want these folks realizing you're a crook, not a social climber."
00:34:15:01,00:34:18:04,You think I care what anyone in this room thinks of me?
00:34:19:20,00:34:22:05,I doubt you care what anyone in any room thinks of you.
00:34:22:08,00:34:26:02,"Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You don't know a thing about me."
00:34:26:17,00:34:30:22,"Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town."
00:34:31:02,00:34:32:22,A modest place for a master jewel thief.
00:34:33:02,00:34:36:09,Which means that either you're saving for retirement...
00:34:36:24,00:34:39:02,...or you're in deep with the wrong people.
00:34:40:10,00:34:44:09,You don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.
00:34:44:13,00:34:48:21,#NAME?
00:34:50:01,00:34:53:10,"Once you've done what you had to, they never let you do what you want to."
00:34:53:14,00:34:54:20,Start fresh.
00:34:55:00,00:34:58:06,Ugh. There's no fresh start in today's world.
00:34:58:09,00:35:01:10,Any 12-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did.
00:35:01:14,00:35:05:10,Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks.
00:35:05:23,00:35:07:24,Is that how you justify stealing?
00:35:08:04,00:35:10:18,I take what I need from those who have more than enough.
00:35:10:22,00:35:13:05,I don't stand on the shoulders of people with less.
00:35:13:09,00:35:14:10,Robin Hood?
00:35:14:14,00:35:18:17,I think I'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you.
00:35:19:16,00:35:21:18,You think maybe you're assuming a little too much?
00:35:21:22,00:35:25:23,Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet.
00:35:26:03,00:35:27:04,Ouch.
00:35:27:16,00:35:32:18,"You think all this can last? There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne."
00:35:33:09,00:35:37:14,"You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits..."
00:35:37:18,00:35:41:15,...you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large...
00:35:41:19,00:35:44:22,...and leave so little for the rest of us.
00:35:48:05,00:35:50:17,You sound like you're looking forward to it.
00:35:52:03,00:35:53:17,I'm adaptable.
00:35:53:21,00:35:57:03,Those pearls do look better on you than they did in my safe.
00:35:57:21,00:36:00:02,But I still can't let you keep them.
00:36:07:18,00:36:09:22,You... You scared her off!
00:36:12:20,00:36:14:09,Not likely.
00:36:16:12,00:36:17:21,Must have lost my ticket.
00:36:18:01,00:36:20:19,#NAME?
00:36:28:20,00:36:30:07,"Just you, sir?"
00:36:33:09,00:36:35:09,"Don't worry, Master Wayne."
00:36:36:03,00:36:39:04,Takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.
00:36:41:08,00:36:44:14,"Bruce Wayne, as I live and breathe."
00:36:46:09,00:36:48:18,"What brings you out of cryo-sleep, Mr. Wayne?"
00:36:48:22,00:36:50:16,You haven't lost your sense of humor.
00:36:50:20,00:36:53:08,Even if you have lost most of my money.
00:36:53:12,00:36:55:00,"Actually, you did that."
00:36:55:04,00:36:57:21,If you funnel your entire R and D budget...
00:36:58:01,00:37:00:23,...into a fusion project that you then mothball...
00:37:01:03,00:37:03:12,...your company is unlikely to thrive.
00:37:03:15,00:37:04:16,What are my options?
00:37:04:20,00:37:07:05,"Well, if you're unwilling to turn on the machine..."
00:37:08:02,00:37:09:23,"I can't. I can't, Lucius."
00:37:10:12,00:37:12:02,"Well, then sit tight."
00:37:12:06,00:37:13:23,Your majority keeps Daggett at bay...
00:37:14:03,00:37:18:03,...while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate.
00:37:18:07,00:37:20:22,She has supported the project all the way.
00:37:21:08,00:37:24:12,She's smart. And quite lovely.
00:37:25:12,00:37:28:13,"We all just want what's best for you, Bruce."
00:37:29:07,00:37:31:01,Show her the machine.
00:37:31:23,00:37:33:06,I'll think it over.
00:37:33:10,00:37:34:18,Anything else?
00:37:34:22,00:37:37:04,Nope. Why?
00:37:37:08,00:37:41:09,These conversations used to end with an unusual request.
00:37:42:03,00:37:43:13,I retired.
00:37:43:20,00:37:47:23,"Mm-hm. Well, let me show you some stuff anyway."
00:37:52:01,00:37:53:14,Just for old times' sake.
00:37:58:01,00:38:00:02,I figured you'd have shut this place down.
00:38:00:06,00:38:02:22,"Oh, it was always shut down, officially."
00:38:03:02,00:38:04:04,All this new stuff.
00:38:04:08,00:38:08:23,"After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up 14 different defense subsidiaries."
00:38:09:03,00:38:11:19,"For years, I've been shuttering and consolidating..."
00:38:11:23,00:38:14:08,...all the different prototypes under one roof.
00:38:14:12,00:38:16:05,#NAME?
00:38:16:12,00:38:19:04,Keep them from falling into the wrong hands.
00:38:22:00,00:38:24:10,"Oh, now you're just showing off."
00:38:25:14,00:38:30:05,Defense Department projects for tight geometry urban pacification.
00:38:30:17,00:38:35:08,Rotors are configured to maneuver between buildings without recirculation.
00:38:35:19,00:38:37:07,What's it called?
00:38:37:22,00:38:42:03,"Oh, it has a long, uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation."
00:38:42:07,00:38:45:16,I just took to calling it the Bat.
00:38:46:14,00:38:49:05,"And, yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black."
00:38:50:24,00:38:53:23,"Works fine, except for the autopilot."
00:38:54:10,00:38:56:08,Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.
00:38:56:12,00:38:57:21,Better mind?
00:38:58:15,00:39:01:10,"Well, I was trying to be modest."
00:39:01:19,00:39:03:17,A less busy mind.
00:39:04:03,00:39:05:10,Yours.
00:39:06:21,00:39:08:13,
00:39:12:23,00:39:16:11,"- Is it really painful? - You're very welcome to try it, Alfred."
00:39:16:14,00:39:18:08,"Happy watching. Thank you, sir."
00:39:21:11,00:39:22:21,Not bad.
00:39:27:22,00:39:29:08,Not bad at all.
00:39:32:19,00:39:35:22,If you're seriously considering going back out there...
00:39:36:02,00:39:38:05,...you should hear the rumors surrounding Bane.
00:39:38:09,00:39:39:10,I'm all ears.
00:39:40:18,00:39:44:10,There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world.
00:39:44:22,00:39:49:19,A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die.
00:39:50:00,00:39:53:18,But sometimes a man rises from the darkness.
00:39:53:23,00:39:58:03,Sometimes the pit sends something back.
00:39:58:06,00:40:00:10,#NAME?
00:40:00:17,00:40:03:18,Born and raised in hell on earth.
00:40:03:22,00:40:07:20,#NAME?
00:40:07:24,00:40:10:14,But they do know that once he did...
00:40:10:18,00:40:14:22,"...he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor."
00:40:15:02,00:40:17:02,Bane was a member of the League of Shadows?
00:40:17:06,00:40:19:10,And then he was excommunicated.
00:40:19:21,00:40:25:14,And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.
00:40:25:18,00:40:29:00,I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.
00:40:29:15,00:40:30:22,That was then.
00:40:31:09,00:40:34:04,And you can strap up your leg and put your mask back on...
00:40:34:08,00:40:36:23,...but that doesn't make you what you were.
00:40:37:02,00:40:41:18,"If this man is everything that you say he is, then the city needs me."
00:40:41:22,00:40:44:21,The city needs Bruce Wayne.
00:40:45:06,00:40:47:04,Your resources. Your knowledge.
00:40:47:08,00:40:50:10,"It doesn't need your body, or your life."
00:40:51:05,00:40:52:09,That time's past.
00:40:52:13,00:40:55:22,"You're afraid that if I go back out there, I'll fail."
00:40:56:02,00:40:57:08,No.
00:40:58:23,00:41:01:19,I'm afraid that you want to.
00:41:12:11,00:41:14:18,
00:41:14:22,00:41:16:04,
00:41:16:07,00:41:19:12,You can't short the stock because Bruce Wayne goes to a party.
00:41:19:16,00:41:23:12,Wayne coming back is change. Change is either good or bad. I vote bad.
00:41:23:16,00:41:24:23,On what basis?
00:41:25:03,00:41:26:16,I flipped a coin.
00:41:32:19,00:41:34:17,"It says rye... I said no rye, man."
00:41:37:07,00:41:40:02,"Hey, rookie, lose the helmet. We need faces for camera."
00:41:40:06,00:41:41:07,
00:41:42:19,00:41:44:10,
00:41:46:03,00:41:48:01,Come on. Let's go scalping.
00:42:03:11,00:42:04:13,Come on.
00:42:21:16,00:42:23:12,
00:42:29:14,00:42:31:11,"Everybody down, now!"
00:42:49:19,00:42:52:12,This is a stock exchange. There's no money you can steal.
00:42:52:16,00:42:56:01,Really? Then why are you people here?
00:43:12:12,00:43:15:06,"Everybody, stay back! Go down to the end of the block!"
00:43:15:10,00:43:17:09,We have an emergency situation!
00:43:20:16,00:43:22:07,You gotta get in there!
00:43:22:10,00:43:24:01,This is a hostage situation.
00:43:24:04,00:43:27:15,"No, this is a robbery. They have direct access to the online trading desk."
00:43:27:19,00:43:29:14,I'm not risking my men for your money.
00:43:33:20,00:43:36:04,We have to ask you to move. We have a situation.
00:43:36:08,00:43:38:09,"It's not our money, it's everybody's."
00:43:38:13,00:43:40:15,Really? Mine's in my mattress.
00:43:40:19,00:43:45:07,"You don't put these guys down, that stuffing in your mattress might be worth a whole lot less."
00:43:45:11,00:43:47:17,Cut the fiber cable and take out that cell tower.
00:43:47:21,00:43:50:09,- Thank you - That'll slow them down.
00:43:51:01,00:43:52:02,Move back!
00:43:52:06,00:43:54:22,"All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please!"
00:43:56:10,00:43:58:00,They cut the fiber.
00:43:59:04,00:44:00:06,Cell's working.
00:44:00:10,00:44:01:19,For now.
00:44:07:10,00:44:11:03,Get all these barriers up. All of them up. No one gets in or out of any of these streets.
00:44:11:07,00:44:12:22,Where am I supposed to move it?
00:44:13:02,00:44:14:09,Back it up.
00:44:18:23,00:44:21:04,"All right, just stay in your vehicle, okay?"
00:44:27:17,00:44:30:03,How much longer does the program need?
00:44:31:17,00:44:32:21,Eight minutes.
00:44:34:11,00:44:35:17,Time to go mobile.
00:44:35:21,00:44:37:05,"Everybody, up!"
00:44:37:09,00:44:38:13,
00:44:41:11,00:44:42:20,"You two, move!"
00:44:45:16,00:44:46:24,Thank you.
00:44:47:22,00:44:49:10,Steady.
00:44:58:03,00:44:59:12,Steady.
00:45:07:10,00:45:08:11,I've got something.
00:45:09:14,00:45:12:02,"Hold your fire, they've got hostages."
00:45:12:06,00:45:13:12,Hold your fire!
00:45:16:09,00:45:17:10,
00:45:18:04,00:45:19:10,
00:45:23:11,00:45:24:23,"Go, go!"
00:45:34:17,00:45:36:09,Please! Just let me go!
00:45:36:17,00:45:39:08,"Hey, please! Hey!"
00:45:42:08,00:45:43:18,Shoot the tires.
00:45:43:22,00:45:45:09,There's no shot.
00:45:46:19,00:45:49:22,"Now back off. Back off, they've got hostages."
00:45:50:02,00:45:52:20,... P.D. are pursuing the four suspects through downtown...
00:45:53:00,00:45:55:01,...in response to a hostage situation.
00:46:01:13,00:46:03:05,What's going on with the lights?
00:46:04:03,00:46:06:06,
00:46:10:03,00:46:11:15,It can't be.
00:46:12:01,00:46:13:04,What the hell was that?
00:46:13:07,00:46:16:04,"Oh, boy, you are in for a show tonight, son."
00:46:21:16,00:46:23:16,"Please! Help, help, help!"
00:46:31:08,00:46:32:22,
00:46:37:17,00:46:39:01,
00:46:41:12,00:46:42:13,Sorry.
00:46:43:04,00:46:46:11,Put that thing away before you hurt yourself. Get in!
00:46:46:15,00:46:49:18,"Let's go. You, get in the car. They've spotted the Batman."
00:47:01:02,00:47:04:05,"Call everyone in. Every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty too."
00:47:04:09,00:47:07:02,Pull them in now. I'm gonna do what Jim Gordon never could.
00:47:07:06,00:47:10:11,- What's that? - I'm gonna take down the Batman.
00:47:10:15,00:47:13:16,... are confirming four suspects are carrying two hostages...
00:47:13:20,00:47:15:21,...kidnapped from the Gotham Stock Exchange.
00:47:16:01,00:47:19:08,#NAME?
00:47:19:12,00:47:21:22,#NAME?
00:47:22:02,00:47:24:18,"Hard to believe, but the suspects are now being pursued..."
00:47:24:22,00:47:26:21,...by what appears to be the Batman.
00:47:27:01,00:47:28:03,"Well, what do you know?"
00:47:33:07,00:47:35:07,"Sir, what about the armed robbers?"
00:47:37:16,00:47:40:16,Please! Just let me go! Please!
00:47:50:08,00:47:53:19,One bike's pulled off. No hostage. Should we pursue?
00:47:58:08,00:47:59:21,Negative. Stay on the Batman.
00:48:02:19,00:48:04:14,- He's getting away. - Who do you wanna catch?
00:48:04:18,00:48:07:07,"Some robber, or the son of a bitch who killed Harvey Dent?"
00:48:11:12,00:48:14:00,...The entire upper west hill...
00:48:14:04,00:48:16:06,Central Heights and East Park Side areas.
00:48:16:15,00:48:19:08,"Eight years, and he has to pick tonight."
00:48:19:16,00:48:21:18,He's drawing the cops off Bane.
00:48:30:14,00:48:32:13,Please! Just let me go!
00:48:33:01,00:48:34:02,Please!
00:48:48:18,00:48:50:07,
00:48:56:03,00:48:57:15,
00:49:06:16,00:49:09:02,
00:49:52:09,00:49:53:18,We lost him.
00:49:53:24,00:49:55:16,How could you lose him?
00:49:55:20,00:49:57:10,He's got a lot of firepower.
00:49:57:14,00:49:58:16,"What, and you don't?"
00:50:03:11,00:50:05:05,He's heading back downtown.
00:50:05:09,00:50:07:10,Then he's as dumb as he dresses.
00:50:08:01,00:50:09:15,"Close it off, gentlemen."
00:50:38:10,00:50:40:04,
00:50:41:23,00:50:44:11,"Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen."
00:50:49:15,00:50:52:18,"You might have the wrong animal there, sir."
00:51:03:15,00:51:05:08,You sure it was him?
00:51:12:04,00:51:15:14,"Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished."
00:51:15:18,00:51:17:09,What about the men they arrested?
00:51:17:13,00:51:21:15,"He said, and I quote, ""They would die before talking."""
00:51:22:20,00:51:25:03,Where does he find these guys?
00:51:26:17,00:51:28:11,Open the champagne.
00:51:30:12,00:51:33:00,And can we get some girls in here?
00:51:33:04,00:51:34:14,Careful what you wish for.
00:51:45:14,00:51:46:23,Cat got your tongue?
00:51:47:02,00:51:48:08,You dumb bitch.
00:51:48:12,00:51:50:14,Nobody ever accused me of being dumb.
00:51:50:18,00:51:53:16,You're dumb for coming here tonight.
00:51:53:20,00:51:54:21,
00:51:55:02,00:51:56:18,I want what you owe me.
00:51:57:09,00:51:58:10,
00:51:58:14,00:52:00:12,Want doesn't get.
00:52:00:24,00:52:05:01,Nice outfit. Those heels make it tough to walk?
00:52:05:05,00:52:06:10,- I don't know. - Aah!
00:52:07:01,00:52:08:10,Do they?
00:52:09:18,00:52:11:08,- So where is it? - Where's what?
00:52:11:13,00:52:13:21,"The program. The ""clean slate."""
00:52:14:03,00:52:17:08,The ultimate tool for a master thief with a record.
00:52:18:02,00:52:19:15,Hold it right there!
00:52:22:17,00:52:24:14,
00:52:33:04,00:52:34:05,Where is it?
00:52:34:18,00:52:36:08,The clean slate?
00:52:36:12,00:52:39:03,"Where you type in someone's name, date of birth..."
00:52:39:07,00:52:43:11,...in a few minutes they're gone from every database on earth?
00:52:43:24,00:52:46:19,- Sound a little too good to be true? - You're lying!
00:52:46:23,00:52:49:13,Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.
00:52:49:17,00:52:51:16,That's why I bought them.
00:52:52:14,00:52:54:11,But they had nothing.
00:52:54:21,00:52:56:14,It was a gangland myth.
00:53:07:22,00:53:09:03,Stay back!
00:53:12:12,00:53:14:03,I'm not bluffing!
00:53:15:01,00:53:16:10,They know.
00:53:16:20,00:53:18:06,They just don't care.
00:53:35:14,00:53:36:21,You've gotta be kidding me.
00:53:37:01,00:53:39:14,- No guns. No killing. - Where's the fun in that?
00:53:58:18,00:54:01:13,My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men.
00:54:01:17,00:54:02:18,This isn't a car.
00:54:52:21,00:54:54:11,See you around.
00:54:55:11,00:54:56:14,You're welcome.
00:54:56:23,00:54:58:08,I had it under control.
00:54:58:12,00:54:59:20,Those weren't street thugs.
00:55:00:00,00:55:02:02,They were trained killers.
00:55:02:06,00:55:03:22,I saved your life.
00:55:04:03,00:55:08:21,"In return, I need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints."
00:55:09:01,00:55:11:15,Wayne wasn't kidding about a powerful friend.
00:55:12:18,00:55:14:15,I sold his prints to Daggett...
00:55:16:15,00:55:19:02,...for something that doesn't even exist.
00:55:19:09,00:55:23:02,"- I doubt many people get the better of you. - Hey, when a girl's desperate..."
00:55:23:06,00:55:25:14,- What's he gonna do with them? - I don't know...
00:55:25:18,00:55:29:03,...but Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market.
00:55:29:07,00:55:31:05,
00:55:34:09,00:55:35:20,Miss Kyle?
00:55:38:18,00:55:40:23,So that's what that feels like.
00:56:00:07,00:56:04:20,I see from the television coverage that you got your taste for wanton destruction back.
00:56:04:24,00:56:06:23,I retrieved this.
00:56:07:03,00:56:09:14,"Aren't the police supposed to be investigating, then?"
00:56:09:18,00:56:13:04,- They don't have the tools to analyze it. - They would if you gave them to them.
00:56:13:08,00:56:15:20,One man's tool is another man's weapon.
00:56:15:24,00:56:19:08,"In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't many things you can't turn into a weapon."
00:56:19:12,00:56:21:15,"Alfred, enough. The police weren't getting it done."
00:56:21:19,00:56:25:04,Perhaps they might have if you hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.
00:56:25:08,00:56:29:03,- You thought I didn't have it in me. - You led a bloated police force on a chase...
00:56:29:07,00:56:31:22,...with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.
00:56:32:01,00:56:34:22,What about when you come up against him? What then?
00:56:35:01,00:56:39:21,"- I'll fight harder. I always have. - Look. His speed, his ferocity, his training."
00:56:40:01,00:56:42:17,I see the power of belief.
00:56:42:21,00:56:45:19,I see the League of Shadows resurgent.
00:56:45:23,00:56:47:10,You said he was excommunicated.
00:56:47:14,00:56:49:11,By Ra's Al Ghul.
00:56:50:12,00:56:51:14,Who leads them now?
00:56:51:18,00:56:54:08,Ra's Al Ghul was the League of Shadows and I beat him.
00:56:54:12,00:56:57:06,Bane is a mercenary. We need to find out what he's up to.
00:56:58:11,00:57:01:00,Trades of some kind. Coded.
00:57:01:20,00:57:04:15,"And my fingerprint, courtesy of Selina Kyle."
00:57:04:19,00:57:05:21,Get this to Fox.
00:57:06:01,00:57:10:09,He can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing.
00:57:14:01,00:57:17:18,"I'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more."
00:57:19:09,00:57:22:23,"I've sewn you up, I've set your bones, but I won't bury you."
00:57:23:09,00:57:26:12,I've buried enough members of the Wayne family.
00:57:27:07,00:57:32:15,- You'll leave me? - You see only one end to your journey.
00:57:33:02,00:57:37:16,Leaving is all I have to make you understand.
00:57:37:23,00:57:41:11,You're not Batman any more. You have to find another way.
00:57:41:15,00:57:45:14,"You used to talk about finishing, about a life beyond that awful cave."
00:57:45:18,00:57:49:11,"Alfred, Rachel died knowing that we had decided to be together."
00:57:49:15,00:57:53:12,That was my life beyond the cave. I can't just move on.
00:57:53:23,00:57:56:20,She... She didn't. She couldn't.
00:57:57:15,00:57:59:00,What if she had?
00:57:59:04,00:58:00:16,She... I can't change that.
00:58:00:19,00:58:03:20,What if before she died she wrote a letter...
00:58:03:24,00:58:07:11,...saying she chose Harvey Dent over you?
00:58:11:20,00:58:13:04,And what if...
00:58:14:06,00:58:16:02,...to spare you pain...
00:58:17:22,00:58:19:19,...I burnt that letter?
00:58:20:15,00:58:24:20,How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?
00:58:25:01,00:58:28:11,"I am using the truth, Master Wayne."
00:58:29:03,00:58:34:00,Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and let it have its day.
00:58:35:15,00:58:37:18,- I'm sorry. - You're sorry?
00:58:37:22,00:58:40:16,You expect to destroy my world...
00:58:43:00,00:58:45:10,...and then think that we're gonna shake hands?
00:58:45:14,00:58:47:06,"No, no, no."
00:58:48:12,00:58:50:14,I know what this means.
00:58:50:18,00:58:51:20,What does it mean?
00:58:51:24,00:58:54:10,It means your hatred.
00:58:54:15,00:58:58:08,And it also means losing someone that I have cared for...
00:58:58:12,00:59:02:22,...since I first heard his cries echo...
00:59:03:14,00:59:05:16,...through this house.
00:59:06:00,00:59:10:06,But it might also mean saving your life.
00:59:11:13,00:59:13:23,And that is more important.
00:59:19:04,00:59:20:05,"Goodbye, Alfred."
00:59:30:03,00:59:31:21,
00:59:39:24,00:59:41:05,Alfred?
00:59:46:10,00:59:49:00,#NAME?
00:59:50:10,00:59:51:17,Page three.
00:59:52:06,00:59:56:06,Seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange...
00:59:56:10,00:59:57:17,...verified by thumbprint.
00:59:57:21,01:00:00:13,Those options expired at midnight last night.
01:00:00:17,01:00:05:19,"Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud. But for now, you're completely broke..."
01:00:05:22,01:00:09:09,...and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett.
01:00:09:13,01:00:13:09,The weapons. We can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences.
01:00:13:13,01:00:16:12,Applied Sciences is all looked up and off the books.
01:00:16:16,01:00:19:21,"The energy project, however, is a different story."
01:00:20:01,01:00:21:13,Miranda Tate.
01:00:22:13,01:00:25:20,Let's convince the board to get behind her. Let's show her the reactor.
01:00:25:24,01:00:29:12,"We're meeting her there in 35 minutes, so you better get dressed."
01:00:29:20,01:00:33:09,"You brought me out here to show me this, Mr. Fox?"
01:00:33:14,01:00:35:13,"Bear with me, Miss Tate."
01:00:39:06,01:00:42:18,Please keep hands and feet inside the car at all times.
01:00:48:07,01:00:50:03,"This is it, isn't it?"
01:00:50:17,01:00:53:07,The reactor is beneath the river...
01:00:53:20,01:00:57:14,...so it can be instantly flooded in the event of a security breach.
01:00:58:07,01:01:01:05,Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?
01:01:01:09,01:01:03:16,I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.
01:01:10:13,01:01:13:11,I thought you might like to see what your investment built.
01:01:13:15,01:01:15:07,No fossil fuels.
01:01:15:11,01:01:18:01,Free clean energy for an entire city.
01:01:18:05,01:01:21:18,"Three years ago, a Russian scientist published a paper..."
01:01:21:22,01:01:24:05,...on weaponized fusion reactions.
01:01:24:09,01:01:29:08,"One week later, your reactor started developing problems."
01:01:30:13,01:01:32:05,I think this machine works.
01:01:32:09,01:01:38:24,"Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great."
01:01:39:04,01:01:42:06,Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist...
01:01:42:10,01:01:45:05,...died in a plane crash six months ago?
01:01:45:09,01:01:48:21,Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.
01:01:49:01,01:01:55:05,Someone will figure out a way to make this power source into a nuclear weapon.
01:01:56:13,01:02:00:22,I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises...
01:02:01:09,01:02:02:15,...and this reactor.
01:02:03:01,01:02:04:04,To do what with it?
01:02:04:08,01:02:05:20,Nothing.
01:02:06:10,01:02:08:13,Until we can guarantee its safety.
01:02:08:17,01:02:09:23,And if we can't?
01:02:10:05,01:02:11:19,Decommission it. Flood it.
01:02:11:22,01:02:15:18,Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?
01:02:15:22,01:02:17:13,"If the world's not ready, yes."
01:02:17:17,01:02:21:24,"Bruce, if you want to save the world, you have to start trusting it."
01:02:22:09,01:02:23:18,I'm trusting you.
01:02:23:22,01:02:25:21,Doesn't count. You have no choice.
01:02:26:15,01:02:28:23,I could have flooded this chamber at any time.
01:02:29:03,01:02:31:04,I'm choosing to trust you.
01:02:32:01,01:02:33:06,Please.
01:02:34:12,01:02:36:22,
01:02:40:12,01:02:44:14,"All right, ladies and gentlemen. This meeting will now come to order."
01:02:44:18,01:02:47:22,I'd like to point out that we have a non-board member here...
01:02:48:02,01:02:51:11,"...which is highly irregular, even if his family name is above the door."
01:02:51:14,01:02:53:20,Bruce Wayne's family built this company.
01:02:54:00,01:02:55:19,And he himself has run it.
01:02:55:23,01:03:00:17,"Into the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree? Check the share price this morning."
01:03:00:21,01:03:05:03,Crazy gambling on futures has not only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...
01:03:05:07,01:03:07:14,...it's cost us all a lot of money.
01:03:07:18,01:03:09:14,And he has to go.
01:03:10:11,01:03:12:11,"I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne."
01:03:20:21,01:03:22:13,"Now, back to business."
01:03:23:06,01:03:26:11,"- Mr. Wayne, over here! - How's it feel to be one of the people?"
01:03:26:15,01:03:30:16,"Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car! I didn't know what to do, they had paperwork."
01:03:32:10,01:03:34:04,"Looks like you need a ride, huh?"
01:03:34:07,01:03:36:13,"Wayne, we'll give you a ride!"
01:03:36:16,01:03:40:24,How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne board?
01:03:41:04,01:03:43:08,She been meeting with him? Sleeping with him?
01:03:43:12,01:03:46:11,"- Not that we know of. - You don't know much of anything, do you?"
01:03:46:15,01:03:48:13,- Where's Bane? - We told him it was urgent.
01:03:48:17,01:03:51:08,#NAME?
01:03:51:12,01:03:53:18,...and he shall appear.
01:03:53:22,01:03:56:09,What the hell is going on?
01:03:57:00,01:04:00:09,#NAME?
01:04:00:13,01:04:03:08,Do I look like I'm running Wayne Enterprises right now?
01:04:03:15,01:04:08:04,"Your hit on the stock exchange, it didn't work, my friend."
01:04:08:08,01:04:13:11,And now you have my construction crews going around the city at 24 hours a day.
01:04:13:15,01:04:18:14,How exactly is that supposed to help my company absorb Wayne's?
01:04:21:04,01:04:23:13,#NAME?
01:04:23:17,01:04:25:07,I'm in charge.
01:04:26:02,01:04:28:11,Do you feel in charge?
01:04:33:12,01:04:35:06,I've paid you a small fortune.
01:04:35:10,01:04:38:09,And this gives you power over me?
01:04:38:23,01:04:40:09,What is this?
01:04:40:13,01:04:45:12,Your money and infrastructure have been important...
01:04:45:21,01:04:47:00,...till now.
01:04:47:12,01:04:48:15,What are you?
01:04:48:19,01:04:50:15,I'm Gotham's reckoning.
01:04:50:19,01:04:53:16,Here to end the borrowed time you've all been living on.
01:04:55:17,01:04:58:20,You're pure evil.
01:04:59:00,01:05:01:08,I'm necessary evil.
01:05:01:12,01:05:03:10,"No. No, no, no!"
01:05:03:14,01:05:05:07,
01:05:07:24,01:05:10:11,"When you started, why the mask?"
01:05:10:15,01:05:13:07,#NAME?
01:05:13:11,01:05:16:14,- You didn't have any family? - There are always people you care about.
01:05:16:18,01:05:20:16,You just don't realize how much until they're gone.
01:05:21:02,01:05:23:23,The idea was to be a symbol.
01:05:24:03,01:05:27:06,Batman could be anybody.
01:05:27:19,01:05:29:08,That was the point.
01:05:29:17,01:05:32:22,#NAME?
01:05:33:03,01:05:37:09,- They'll figure that out in the end. - You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?
01:05:37:21,01:05:41:03,Yeah. I got 500 pages of tunnel records and a flashlight.
01:05:41:06,01:05:43:09,"I could use some help, actually."
01:05:44:09,01:05:46:06,You know what? Drop me in Old Town.
01:05:49:21,01:05:51:11,"Hey, hey, hey. I don't think so!"
01:05:51:15,01:05:53:19,- That's the way this works! - I don't think so!
01:05:53:23,01:05:56:05,- That is the way - He's not a mark.
01:05:56:09,01:05:59:01,"And he doesn't have a cent to his name, anyway."
01:05:59:13,01:06:03:20,"Yeah, it's not much. But it's more than you've got right now."
01:06:04:00,01:06:06:10,"Actually, they're letting me keep the house."
01:06:06:14,01:06:09:04,"The rich don't even go broke the same as the rest of us, huh?"
01:06:09:08,01:06:13:07,My powerful friend might hope to change your mind about leaving.
01:06:13:11,01:06:16:02,#NAME?
01:06:16:06,01:06:18:22,- It doesn't exist. - He says it does.
01:06:19:15,01:06:21:09,He wants to meet tonight.
01:06:21:12,01:06:22:14,Why?
01:06:22:17,01:06:25:16,He needs to find Bane. Says you'd know how.
01:06:28:24,01:06:31:05,- Tell him I'll think about it. - Okay.
01:06:31:09,01:06:33:06,I like your place.
01:06:34:17,01:06:35:20,Mr. Wayne?
01:06:38:11,01:06:40:17,I'm sorry they took all your money.
01:06:41:19,01:06:43:02,"No, you're not."
01:06:44:05,01:06:47:00,#NAME?
01:06:47:04,01:06:50:17,John Daggett's body was just found in a Dumpster about an hour ago.
01:06:50:21,01:06:52:20,#NAME?
01:06:53:00,01:06:57:03,"His name's all over these permits I just pulled to, uh, map the tunnels under Gotham."
01:06:57:07,01:07:01:04,"That's MTA maintenance, uh, sewer construction, couple of other things."
01:07:01:08,01:07:04:09,Where did you get to with the tunnel searches?
01:07:04:12,01:07:07:10,Remind me to tell detail to keep hotheads out.
01:07:07:14,01:07:09:18,We've had teams down there. It's a huge network.
01:07:09:22,01:07:13:06,"Well, get more men. Work a grid. I want him found."
01:07:13:10,01:07:15:18,"Yeah, the, uh, masked man. We're on it."
01:07:15:22,01:07:18:16,"Lose the uniform, you're working for me now."
01:07:18:20,01:07:21:06,We could use some hotter heads around here.
01:07:21:10,01:07:25:13,"- Sir, that could also be a coincidence. - You're a detective now, son."
01:07:25:17,01:07:28:20,You're not allowed to believe in coincidence any more.
01:07:30:12,01:07:32:23,
01:07:40:00,01:07:41:13,Nobody's answering.
01:07:41:22,01:07:43:03,No.
01:07:43:06,01:07:44:23,I'm on my own now.
01:07:45:18,01:07:47:05,Do you have keys?
01:07:48:10,01:07:49:14,Never needed them.
01:07:56:06,01:07:57:24,Hope you didn't like me for my money.
01:07:58:18,01:08:01:08,Suffering builds character.
01:08:07:09,01:08:09:22,"I'll take care of your parents' legacy, Bruce."
01:08:12:02,01:08:13:10,Who's this?
01:08:21:06,01:08:22:15,Where's Alfred?
01:08:24:09,01:08:25:18,He left...
01:08:27:10,01:08:29:10,...taking everything.
01:08:53:09,01:08:54:18,What's that?
01:08:55:13,01:08:57:20,My power's been shut off.
01:08:58:08,01:08:59:19,
01:09:03:08,01:09:04:20,You're good at that.
01:09:05:22,01:09:08:21,"When I was a child, we had almost nothing."
01:09:09:07,01:09:13:20,"But on the nights when we had a fire, we felt very rich indeed."
01:09:15:16,01:09:18:15,I assumed your family was wealthy.
01:09:19:10,01:09:20:22,Not always.
01:09:21:22,01:09:23:11,Not when I was young.
01:09:24:03,01:09:25:23,An old mistake.
01:09:27:02,01:09:28:23,I've made a few myself.
01:09:30:05,01:09:31:20,More than a few.
01:09:34:02,01:09:35:14,We could leave.
01:09:36:02,01:09:37:03,Tonight.
01:09:38:00,01:09:42:01,"Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted."
01:09:43:20,01:09:45:15,"Someday, perhaps."
01:09:46:14,01:09:48:02,Not tonight.
01:10:16:06,01:10:18:02,Don't be shy.
01:10:20:06,01:10:22:16,Wayne says you can get me the clean slate.
01:10:23:00,01:10:25:18,#NAME?
01:10:25:22,01:10:27:13,On what you want it for.
01:10:27:17,01:10:30:16,I acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands.
01:10:31:10,01:10:33:05,"Still don't trust me, huh?"
01:10:34:08,01:10:36:09,How can we change that?
01:10:36:13,01:10:38:08,Start by taking me to Bane.
01:10:41:09,01:10:42:23,You asked.
01:10:45:06,01:10:47:07,"From here, Bane's men patrol the tunnels."
01:10:47:15,01:10:50:02,And they're not your average brawlers.
01:10:50:14,01:10:52:02,Neither am I.
01:10:59:21,01:11:00:23,- He's behind you. - Who?
01:11:01:03,01:11:02:04,Me.
01:11:07:08,01:11:09:08,What do you think you're...?
01:11:21:11,01:11:23:16,Just a little further.
01:11:30:21,01:11:33:10,I had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me.
01:11:33:14,01:11:36:00,You made a serious mistake.
01:11:36:14,01:11:41:12,"Not as serious as yours, I fear."
01:11:45:04,01:11:46:05,Bane.
01:11:46:09,01:11:49:12,Let's not stand on ceremony here...
01:11:50:17,01:11:53:02,...Mr. Wayne.
01:12:04:07,01:12:06:11,Peace has cost you your strength.
01:12:06:15,01:12:08:11,Victory has defeated you.
01:12:15:23,01:12:18:01,
01:12:56:22,01:12:58:09,
01:13:10:05,01:13:15:20,"Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated."
01:13:16:00,01:13:18:20,"But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?"
01:13:19:17,01:13:22:14,Members of the League of Shadows.
01:13:24:14,01:13:26:23,And you betrayed us.
01:13:27:19,01:13:30:17,"""Us""? You were excommunicated..."
01:13:30:21,01:13:33:10,...by a gang of psychopaths.
01:13:37:21,01:13:40:19,I am the League of Shadows.
01:13:40:23,01:13:44:02,And I'm here to fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.
01:13:57:15,01:13:59:18,You fight like a younger man.
01:13:59:21,01:14:02:05,Nothing held back.
01:14:02:09,01:14:05:14,"Admirable, but mistaken."
01:14:08:24,01:14:13:14,"Oh, you think darkness is your ally?"
01:14:13:18,01:14:16:11,But you merely adopted the dark.
01:14:17:03,01:14:19:04,I was born in it.
01:14:19:18,01:14:21:21,Molded by it.
01:14:23:01,01:14:26:03,I didn't see the light until I was already a man.
01:14:26:07,01:14:29:13,"By then, it was nothing to me but blinding!"
01:14:32:13,01:14:36:13,The shadows betray you because they belong to me!
01:14:41:21,01:14:45:03,I will show you where I have made my home...
01:14:45:07,01:14:48:15,...whilst preparing to bring justice.
01:14:50:20,01:14:53:01,Then I will break you.
01:15:01:19,01:15:03:16,Your precious armory.
01:15:04:08,01:15:07:16,Gratefully accepted. We will need it.
01:15:16:09,01:15:20:04,"Ah, yes. I was wondering what would break first."
01:15:20:08,01:15:21:20,
01:15:24:22,01:15:26:18,Your spirit...
01:15:31:04,01:15:32:21,...or your body.
01:16:16:21,01:16:19:24,Get me Commissioner Gordon. I got a line on the congressman's kidnapping.
01:16:33:02,01:16:34:06,#NAME?
01:16:34:10,01:16:37:14,"I'm gonna need to see your ticket and identification, please."
01:16:37:18,01:16:39:19,Oh. Do you mind?
01:16:52:15,01:16:55:18,I showed your picture to the congressman. Guess what.
01:16:56:01,01:16:58:14,Don't tell me. Still in love?
01:16:58:18,01:17:01:07,"Oh, head over heels. Pressing charges, though."
01:17:02:08,01:17:05:05,"You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle."
01:17:06:04,01:17:09:08,- Girl's gotta eat. - And you have an appetite.
01:17:09:16,01:17:11:22,Why would you run? You can't hide with a record like this.
01:17:12:02,01:17:14:03,Maybe it's not you I'm running from.
01:17:14:07,01:17:16:04,Who then? Bane?
01:17:16:08,01:17:17:19,What do you know about him?
01:17:18:20,01:17:22:08,That you should be as afraid of him as I am.
01:17:22:11,01:17:24:08,We can offer you protection.
01:17:27:15,01:17:28:17,Okay.
01:17:33:09,01:17:36:21,"When I spotted you, I was looking for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne."
01:17:39:18,01:17:41:06,Did they kill him?
01:17:42:24,01:17:44:15,I'm not sure.
01:17:56:15,01:17:57:17,
01:18:04:10,01:18:06:01,Why didn't you just...
01:18:08:01,01:18:09:06,...kill me?
01:18:09:09,01:18:12:21,"You don't fear death, you welcome it."
01:18:13:10,01:18:16:04,Your punishment must be more severe.
01:18:16:22,01:18:18:12,Torture?
01:18:18:20,01:18:19:22,Yes.
01:18:20:21,01:18:22:18,But not of your body.
01:18:26:10,01:18:27:21,Of your soul.
01:18:29:08,01:18:30:11,Where am I?
01:18:30:24,01:18:32:01,Home.
01:18:33:00,01:18:35:22,Where I learned the truth about despair.
01:18:36:22,01:18:38:06,As will you.
01:18:38:21,01:18:42:11,There is a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth:
01:18:43:06,01:18:44:15,Hope.
01:18:44:19,01:18:47:22,Every man who has rotted here over the centuries...
01:18:48:02,01:18:51:13,...has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom.
01:18:52:14,01:18:53:23,So easy.
01:18:54:21,01:18:56:03,So simple.
01:18:57:02,01:19:02:16,And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater from uncontrollable thirst...
01:19:04:18,01:19:06:17,...many have died trying.
01:19:07:14,01:19:11:07,I learned here there can be no true despair without hope.
01:19:13:04,01:19:15:20,So as I terrorize Gotham...
01:19:16:00,01:19:19:23,...I will feed its people hope to poison their souls.
01:19:20:09,01:19:22:22,I will let them believe that they can survive...
01:19:23:02,01:19:29:02,...so that you can watch them clambering over each other to stay in the sun.
01:19:31:21,01:19:35:01,You can watch me torture an entire city.
01:19:35:16,01:19:39:08,And then when you have truly understood the depth of your failure...
01:19:39:15,01:19:42:14,...we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.
01:19:46:06,01:19:48:04,We will destroy Gotham.
01:19:49:11,01:19:51:22,"And then, when it is done..."
01:19:52:09,01:19:53:24,...and Gotham is...
01:19:55:20,01:19:57:05,...ashes...
01:20:02:21,01:20:05:15,...then you have my permission to die.
01:20:07:08,01:20:09:00,
01:20:10:08,01:20:12:05,
01:20:18:12,01:20:19:19,
01:20:19:23,01:20:21:11,You're looking her up in here?
01:20:21:15,01:20:25:11,The Dent Act allows non-segregation based on extraordinary need.
01:20:25:15,01:20:28:17,"First time she broke out of women's correctional, she was 16."
01:20:28:21,01:20:30:01,"Little closer, baby."
01:20:30:05,01:20:32:07,"Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?"
01:20:32:11,01:20:33:12,
01:20:33:16,01:20:35:09,She's gonna be fine.
01:20:36:06,01:20:39:10,I still don't see the need of a board meeting for the energy project.
01:20:39:14,01:20:41:04,Bruce got a lot of things right.
01:20:41:08,01:20:43:20,Keeping the board in the dark was not one of them.
01:20:46:10,01:20:47:21,How good of you to join us.
01:20:48:14,01:20:51:05,Chair. President.
01:20:51:09,01:20:55:02,All I need now is one more ordinary board member.
01:20:55:05,01:20:58:16,"Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?"
01:20:58:19,01:21:00:02,No.
01:21:00:06,01:21:01:18,I will volunteer.
01:21:02:04,01:21:03:20,Where are you taking us?
01:21:06:01,01:21:07:24,
01:21:14:11,01:21:17:07,"You were right, commissioner. Will you excuse us, please?"
01:21:17:15,01:21:18:16,What happened?
01:21:18:20,01:21:20:23,Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board.
01:21:21:03,01:21:24:01,"He let most of them go, but he took three into the sewers."
01:21:24:05,01:21:26:13,No more patrols. No more hide and seek.
01:21:26:17,01:21:29:10,Get every available cop down there and smoke him out!
01:21:29:14,01:21:31:03,The mayor won't want panic.
01:21:31:07,01:21:33:11,So it's a training exercise.
01:21:35:21,01:21:38:08,I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.
01:21:39:02,01:21:40:04,Not you.
01:21:40:07,01:21:42:17,You're telling me the Batman's gone...
01:21:42:21,01:21:47:14,...so you chase up the Daggett leads any way you can.
01:21:47:22,01:21:48:23,"Yes, sir."
01:21:55:02,01:21:57:14,
01:21:59:09,01:22:04:20,He asks how much you would pay us to let you die.
01:22:05:00,01:22:07:00,I told him. I told him you have nothing.
01:22:07:18,01:22:09:00,Do it for the pleasure.
01:22:09:12,01:22:12:11,They pay me more than that to keep you alive.
01:22:16:12,01:22:19:08,
01:22:20:06,01:22:22:03,He will try the climb.
01:22:22:15,01:22:24:21,
01:22:36:14,01:22:39:01,Has anyone ever made it?
01:22:39:23,01:22:41:10,Of course not.
01:22:42:08,01:22:43:17,
01:22:49:19,01:22:51:03,
01:22:51:22,01:22:54:07,He says there is one who did.
01:22:55:05,01:22:56:19,A child.
01:22:58:01,01:23:00:02,A child born in this hell.
01:23:01:00,01:23:02:15,Bane.
01:23:02:19,01:23:05:22,An old legend. Nothing more.
01:23:09:17,01:23:10:21,Don't.
01:23:11:01,01:23:15:10,"Whatever it is they want you to see, it's happening soon."
01:23:41:01,01:23:42:19,Fire in the hole!
01:23:46:13,01:23:48:09,
01:24:11:13,01:24:13:01,Turn it on.
01:24:16:18,01:24:21:15,I only need one other board member. There are eight others waiting.
01:24:21:18,01:24:23:06,I won't do it.
01:24:23:17,01:24:24:19,"All right, stop."
01:24:26:07,01:24:29:06,"Lucius, you'll kill this man, and yourself..."
01:24:29:10,01:24:31:05,...and you'll barely slow them down.
01:24:37:06,01:24:38:13,
01:24:52:07,01:24:54:07,
01:24:57:19,01:25:00:00,"Go on, then. Do your work."
01:25:03:00,01:25:05:03,Take them up to the surface.
01:25:05:07,01:25:07:04,People of their status...
01:25:07:08,01:25:12:15,...deserve to experience the next era of western civilization.
01:25:16:15,01:25:20:18,I've been to half of Daggett's cement plants and locations they poured underground.
01:25:20:22,01:25:23:07,Anything strange about the pourings?
01:25:23:20,01:25:27:06,"Honestly, commissioner, I don't know anything about civil engineering."
01:25:27:10,01:25:30:08,But you know about patterns. Keep looking.
01:25:35:18,01:25:36:21,It's done.
01:25:37:01,01:25:41:09,This is now a 4-megaton nuclear bomb.
01:25:42:15,01:25:45:09,Pull the core out of the reactor.
01:25:46:22,01:25:48:19,"No, you cannot."
01:25:49:03,01:25:52:20,This is the only power source capable of sustaining it.
01:25:53:06,01:25:57:02,"If you move it, the core will decay in a matter of months."
01:25:57:06,01:25:59:10,"Five, by my calculations."
01:25:59:14,01:26:01:06,And then it will go off!
01:26:03:01,01:26:07:00,"And for the sake of your children, Dr. Pavel..."
01:26:07:04,01:26:09:10,...indeed I hope it does.
01:26:10:02,01:26:12:18,Hey. Hey!
01:26:14:17,01:26:17:20,"That was you in front of the stock exchange, wasn't it?"
01:26:18:11,01:26:20:03,#NAME?
01:26:20:07,01:26:24:14,When cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck was shutting them out.
01:26:24:18,01:26:28:08,"- Oh, yeah. You're the cop. - Detective now."
01:26:28:11,01:26:32:12,"And, uh, as a detective, we're not allowed to believe in coincidence."
01:26:42:06,01:26:45:06,What were you doing here? What are you working on?
01:26:52:18,01:26:54:07,"Commissioner, it's Blake."
01:26:54:11,01:26:59:00,I got two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me whenev...
01:26:59:10,01:27:02:18,Wait a minute. I'm looking at four barrels of polyisobutylene.
01:27:04:13,01:27:06:19,That looks like motor oil right next to it.
01:27:06:23,01:27:10:05,"Jesus, they're not making cement. They're making explosives."
01:27:17:22,01:27:20:16,- Patch me in to Foley - Foley's overseeing the operation.
01:27:20:20,01:27:22:04,They're heading into a trap!
01:27:23:10,01:27:26:01,We're seeing thousands of police heading into the sewers.
01:27:26:05,01:27:29:16,"- Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands. - It's a training exercise, that's all."
01:27:29:20,01:27:33:21,"Now if you'll excuse me, I've got tickets to watch our boys thrash Rapid City."
01:27:35:19,01:27:37:19,- Foley - It's a trap! Pull everyone out!
01:27:37:23,01:27:39:12,Bane has been pouring concrete...
01:27:39:16,01:27:41:15,...laced with explosives! - Where?
01:27:43:21,01:27:51:09,"Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light"
01:27:52:06,01:27:57:23,What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's...
01:27:58:07,01:28:02:01,There's a ring around the tunnels! They'll blow it and trap the cops underground!
01:28:03:03,01:28:05:23,Pull them out. Pull them out now!
01:28:06:03,01:28:10:05,Through the perilous fight
01:28:10:17,01:28:14:12,O'er the ramparts we watched
01:28:15:01,01:28:19:02,Were so gallantly streaming
01:28:19:13,01:28:23:07,And the rockets' red glare
01:28:23:23,01:28:27:17,The bombs bursting in air
01:28:28:06,01:28:29:23,Gave proof through...
01:28:30:04,01:28:32:08,"That's a lovely, lovely voice."
01:28:32:12,01:28:36:15,...that our ﬂag was still there
01:28:37:10,01:28:45:10,"Oh, say does that star-spangled banner Yet wave"
01:28:47:16,01:28:52:17,O'er the land of the free
01:28:53:15,01:28:59:17,And the home of the brave
01:29:05:13,01:29:07:20,
01:29:09:12,01:29:10:17,
01:29:13:03,01:29:14:22,Let the games begin.
01:29:18:11,01:29:20:17,
01:29:32:13,01:29:34:08,
01:29:44:19,01:29:46:18,
01:30:31:09,01:30:33:07,Everybody okay?
01:30:34:03,01:30:35:24,"- Let's move! Move, move!< - Go, go!"
01:30:49:24,01:30:51:12,Gotham...
01:30:53:07,01:30:55:11,...take control.
01:30:56:05,01:30:59:15,Take control of your city.
01:31:04:20,01:31:06:17,#NAME?
01:31:06:21,01:31:08:19,Every cop in the city's in those tunnels.
01:31:09:21,01:31:11:06,Not every cop.
01:31:13:08,01:31:15:12,
01:31:25:08,01:31:28:10,"Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer. I need your car right now."
01:31:33:14,01:31:35:07,
01:32:08:04,01:32:09:23,
01:32:19:13,01:32:21:13,"Clear the corners, rookie."
01:32:22:16,01:32:23:22,"Get my coat, son."
01:32:24:02,01:32:25:20,This...
01:32:26:19,01:32:29:19,This is the instrument of your liberation.
01:32:32:11,01:32:35:07,Satellite shows a radiation spike.
01:32:36:03,01:32:38:10,"Whatever it is, it's nuclear."
01:32:42:21,01:32:46:03,Identify yourself to the world.
01:32:47:11,01:32:51:22,"Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist."
01:32:52:07,01:32:54:15,Pavel was confirmed dead.
01:32:54:19,01:32:58:08,"Plane crash on an agency pull out of Uzbekistan, but..."
01:32:59:08,01:33:00:11,It looks like it's him.
01:33:00:18,01:33:03:24,And what...? What is this?
01:33:04:04,01:33:08:01,It's a fully primed neutron bomb...
01:33:08:05,01:33:10:14,...with a blast radius of six miles.
01:33:11:10,01:33:14:19,And who is capable of disarming such a device?
01:33:16:21,01:33:18:04,Only me.
01:33:18:22,01:33:20:13,Only you.
01:33:21:13,01:33:23:20,"Thank you, good doctor!"
01:33:24:08,01:33:26:02,
01:33:26:10,01:33:29:18,"Now, this bomb is armed!"
01:33:29:21,01:33:32:12,And this bomb is mobile!
01:33:32:16,01:33:37:05,And the identity of the triggerman is a mystery.
01:33:37:18,01:33:42:14,For one of you holds the detonator!
01:33:43:00,01:33:46:09,"Now, we come here not as conquerors..."
01:33:46:13,01:33:52:04,"...but as liberators, to return control of this city to the people."
01:33:53:08,01:33:58:02,And at the first sign of interference from the outside world...
01:33:58:19,01:34:02:14,...or from those people attempting to flee...
01:34:04:12,01:34:07:03,...this anonymous Gothamite...
01:34:07:07,01:34:12:04,"...this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb."
01:34:14:14,01:34:16:23,"For now, martial law is in effect."
01:34:17:16,01:34:22:11,"Return to your homes, hold your families close..."
01:34:23:18,01:34:25:04,...and wait.
01:34:26:07,01:34:29:08,"Tomorrow, you claim what is rightfully yours."
01:34:35:15,01:34:37:06,Pull back the fighters.
01:34:38:02,01:34:40:17,Start high-level reconnaissance flights.
01:34:41:16,01:34:43:11,Get the president on the line.
01:35:03:23,01:35:08:14,Tanks and planes cannot stop us from detonating our device.
01:35:09:01,01:35:14:08,Send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication.
01:35:19:05,01:35:21:08,"How many of you are there, son?"
01:35:22:23,01:35:26:18,You don't have enough men to stop 12 million people from leaving this island.
01:35:27:13,01:35:29:23,"No. No, we don't."
01:35:30:03,01:35:31:04,But you do.
01:35:31:09,01:35:32:18,
01:35:32:22,01:35:36:04,"Now, why the hell would I try to help you keep your hostages?"
01:35:36:08,01:35:39:08,If one person crosses this bridge...
01:35:39:12,01:35:41:07,...Gotham gets blown to hell.
01:35:47:05,01:35:50:00,The people of our greatest city are resilient.
01:35:51:02,01:35:54:15,"They have proven this before, and they will prove it again."
01:35:56:14,01:35:59:14,We do not negotiate with terrorists...
01:36:00:11,01:36:02:08,...but we do recognize realities.
01:36:03:10,01:36:05:13,As this situation develops...
01:36:06:01,01:36:09:05,...one thing must be understood above all others.
01:36:11:09,01:36:14:07,"People of Gotham, we have not abandoned you."
01:36:14:11,01:36:15:19,What does that mean?
01:36:16:10,01:36:18:17,It means we're on our own.
01:36:19:05,01:36:20:22,I have to get in front of a camera.
01:36:21:09,01:36:23:15,They will kill you the second you show your face.
01:36:24:09,01:36:28:06,Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the people. They need to know I could lead.
01:36:28:10,01:36:30:00,Bane's not gonna let that happen.
01:36:30:04,01:36:31:17,Then he'll show his true colors.
01:36:31:21,01:36:33:12,And you'll be dead.
01:36:52:04,01:36:57:06,Behind you stands a symbol of oppression.
01:36:57:21,01:36:59:08,Blackgate Prison...
01:36:59:12,01:37:03:02,...where a thousand men have languished...
01:37:03:06,01:37:06:18,...under the name of this man:
01:37:06:22,01:37:09:00,Harvey Dent.
01:37:09:18,01:37:12:08,Who has been held up to you...
01:37:12:12,01:37:17:00,...as the shining example of justice!
01:37:17:04,01:37:20:04,We're just gonna keep moving you till we can get you in front of the camera.
01:37:20:08,01:37:24:08,You have been supplied with a false idol to stop you...
01:37:24:11,01:37:26:22,...tearing down this corrupt city!
01:37:27:02,01:37:28:17,Yes! Yes! Yes!
01:37:28:21,01:37:32:12,Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent.
01:37:32:16,01:37:37:12,From the words of Gotham's police commissioner...
01:37:37:16,01:37:40:01,...James Gordon:
01:37:40:15,01:37:43:23,"""The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent."
01:37:44:03,01:37:46:01,He saved my boy...
01:37:46:06,01:37:50:16,...then took the blame for Harvey's appalling crimes...
01:37:50:20,01:37:53:11,"...so that I could, to my shame..."
01:37:53:15,01:37:57:06,...build a lie around this...
01:37:57:10,01:38:00:04,...fallen idol.
01:38:02:10,01:38:07:09,I praised the madman who tried to murder my own child.
01:38:07:14,01:38:11:08,"Well, I can no longer live with my lie."
01:38:11:12,01:38:15:06,It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth...
01:38:15:10,01:38:19:12,"...and it is time for me to resign."""
01:38:20:11,01:38:23:19,And do you accept this man's resignation?
01:38:23:23,01:38:25:08,
01:38:25:14,01:38:29:19,And do you accept the resignation of all of these liars?
01:38:29:23,01:38:31:15,Of all the corrupt?
01:38:35:10,01:38:37:16,Those men locked up for eight years in Blackgate...
01:38:37:20,01:38:42:02,"...and denied parole under the Dent Act, it was based on a lie."
01:38:43:03,01:38:44:18,Gotham needed a hero.
01:38:44:22,01:38:49:04,"Well, it needs it now more than ever, but you betrayed everything you stood for."
01:38:51:02,01:38:56:18,There's a point far out there when the structures fail you...
01:38:56:22,01:38:59:19,...when the rules aren't weapons any more...
01:39:00:12,01:39:03:23,"...they're shackles, letting the bad guy get ahead."
01:39:05:15,01:39:09:01,"One day, you may face..."
01:39:09:05,01:39:10:21,...such a moment of crisis.
01:39:11:01,01:39:14:08,"And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did..."
01:39:15:00,01:39:20:04,"...to plunge their hands into the filth, so that you can keep yours clean!"
01:39:21:17,01:39:24:09,"Your hands look plenty filthy to me, commissioner."
01:39:26:00,01:39:29:12,We take Gotham from the corrupt!
01:39:31:20,01:39:32:22,The rich!
01:39:33:20,01:39:35:19,The oppressors of generations...
01:39:35:23,01:39:40:03,...who have kept you down with myths of opportunity.
01:39:40:07,01:39:43:08,And we give it back to you...
01:39:43:23,01:39:46:04,...the people.
01:39:47:06,01:39:49:04,Gotham is yours!
01:39:49:15,01:39:52:23,None shall interfere. Do as you please.
01:39:55:05,01:39:58:17,But start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed!
01:39:58:21,01:40:00:14,Open it!
01:40:08:12,01:40:11:14,"Step forward, those who would serve..."
01:40:13:04,01:40:14:22,...for an army will be raised.
01:40:19:04,01:40:23:18,The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests...
01:40:28:11,01:40:33:23,...and cast out into the cold world that we know and endure!
01:40:38:13,01:40:40:15,Courts will be convened.
01:40:48:07,01:40:50:15,Spoils will be enjoyed.
01:40:55:10,01:40:57:01,Blood will be shed!
01:41:00:09,01:41:03:01,The police will survive...
01:41:03:05,01:41:07:15,...as they learn to serve true justice.
01:41:08:18,01:41:11:06,This great city...
01:41:13:10,01:41:14:22,...it will endure.
01:41:17:15,01:41:21:09,Gotham will survive!
01:41:24:21,01:41:27:14,
01:41:35:14,01:41:36:18,
01:41:39:12,01:41:43:01,
01:41:43:05,01:41:45:15,He says you must first fix your back.
01:41:45:21,01:41:46:24,How does he know?
01:41:47:04,01:41:48:14,He was the prison doctor.
01:41:48:18,01:41:52:15,He's a morphine addict who incurred the displeasure...
01:41:52:19,01:41:56:17,"...of powerful people, including your masked friend."
01:41:57:15,01:41:59:03,How?
01:42:00:09,01:42:04:16,"Many years ago, it was a time of plague."
01:42:06:06,01:42:09:09,Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.
01:42:11:09,01:42:15:02,The doctor's fumbling attempts to repair the damage...
01:42:15:20,01:42:17:12,...left him in perpetual agony.
01:42:17:15,01:42:20:20,The mask holds the pain at bay.
01:42:20:24,01:42:24:08,Bane was the child you spoke of?
01:42:24:12,01:42:25:19,He was born here?
01:42:26:18,01:42:31:05,The legend is that there was a mercenary who worked for a local warlord.
01:42:31:23,01:42:34:07,He fell in love with the warlord's daughter.
01:42:34:19,01:42:36:09,They were married in secret.
01:42:36:13,01:42:38:13,When the warlord found out...
01:42:39:01,01:42:42:21,...the mercenary was condemned to this pit.
01:42:43:11,01:42:45:17,But then he exiled him instead.
01:42:45:21,01:42:49:22,The mercenary understood that it was the daughter who had secured his release.
01:42:50:02,01:42:54:23,But what he could not know was the true price of his freedom.
01:42:56:00,01:42:57:20,She took his place in the pit.
01:43:00:23,01:43:02:12,And she was with child...
01:43:02:16,01:43:04:14,...the mercenary's child.
01:43:07:04,01:43:10:09,Innocence cannot flower underground. It has to be stamped out.
01:43:12:24,01:43:18:23,"One day, the doctor forgot to lock the cell."
01:43:25:17,01:43:28:01,But the child had a friend...
01:43:28:12,01:43:33:24,...a protector who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption.
01:43:34:03,01:43:35:21,It was to be prized.
01:43:36:00,01:43:37:18,The mother was not so lucky.
01:43:38:08,01:43:40:02,
01:43:40:22,01:43:44:15,This is Bane's prison now. He wouldn't want this story told.
01:43:47:04,01:43:49:05,
01:43:55:24,01:43:59:17,There's a vertebra protruding from your back.
01:44:00:02,01:44:02:04,It has to be put back.
01:44:02:23,01:44:04:22,
01:44:07:04,01:44:09:23,Stay like this until you stand.
01:44:17:06,01:44:22:22,"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Did you not think I would return, Bruce? Hmm?"
01:44:23:14,01:44:25:05,
01:44:28:14,01:44:30:05,I told you I was immortal.
01:44:32:18,01:44:34:21,I watched... I watched you die.
01:44:35:01,01:44:38:00,"Oh, there are many forms of immortality."
01:44:39:22,01:44:41:09,"Once, I had a wife..."
01:44:42:22,01:44:44:15,...my great love.
01:44:46:00,01:44:49:09,#NAME?
01:44:53:10,01:44:55:09,Bane is your child.
01:44:57:00,01:44:58:01,Your heir.
01:44:58:05,01:45:00:23,An heir to ensure the League of Shadows fulfills its duty...
01:45:01:03,01:45:03:18,...to restore balance to civilization.
01:45:03:22,01:45:04:24,No.
01:45:05:04,01:45:08:14,You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years...
01:45:08:18,01:45:10:16,...with all your strength...
01:45:11:01,01:45:15:06,"...all your resources, all your moral authority."
01:45:15:24,01:45:18:24,And the only victory you could achieve was a lie.
01:45:19:15,01:45:22:12,Now you understand. Gotham is beyond saving.
01:45:22:16,01:45:23:19,No.
01:45:23:23,01:45:26:02,- And must be allowed to die. - No!
01:45:33:00,01:45:35:00,"Yeah, just lift your head."
01:45:35:10,01:45:36:20,"Oh, that's good."
01:45:42:16,01:45:43:18,"No, no!"
01:46:19:02,01:46:21:11,- What's that? - This was someone's home.
01:46:21:14,01:46:23:12,And now it's everyone's home.
01:46:25:07,01:46:28:09,"There's a storm coming, remember? This is what you wanted."
01:46:52:18,01:46:54:23,
01:46:57:11,01:47:00:06,"It's for the bus, in case there's a chance to evacuate."
01:47:00:10,01:47:01:23,Any news? Is the commissioner...?
01:47:02:03,01:47:05:12,"The less you know, Father. How are the boys doing?"
01:47:05:15,01:47:08:11,"Well, we've had more power on so they've got some TV."
01:47:08:14,01:47:09:23,It's good to see you.
01:47:10:16,01:47:14:17,"Blake, you be careful out there. They're hunting down cops like dogs."
01:47:20:10,01:47:21:17,Why build yourself?
01:47:24:01,01:47:29:00,"- I'm not meant to die in here. - Here, there. What's the difference?"
01:47:36:05,01:47:38:14,
01:48:13:22,01:48:15:15,
01:48:30:17,01:48:34:02,I told you it could not be done.
01:48:34:06,01:48:35:21,You told me a child did it.
01:48:36:01,01:48:37:02,
01:48:37:06,01:48:39:13,But no ordinary child.
01:48:39:17,01:48:42:12,A child born in hell.
01:48:46:20,01:48:48:07,Forged from suffering.
01:48:50:10,01:48:52:17,Hardened by pain.
01:48:54:06,01:48:56:21,Not a man from privilege.
01:49:15:23,01:49:17:22,"We got boots on the ground, sir."
01:49:18:17,01:49:19:19,Just waiting on intel.
01:49:25:12,01:49:26:13,You have ID?
01:49:27:06,01:49:28:07,Of course not.
01:49:28:11,01:49:31:00,"- Well, how can we trust you? - We don't have any choice."
01:49:31:21,01:49:34:05,"Commissioner Gordon. Captain Jones, Special Forces."
01:49:34:09,01:49:35:22,Captain. Glad to have you here.
01:49:36:02,01:49:38:18,"It's our job, sir. Now, uh, how many of you are there?"
01:49:38:22,01:49:41:20,"Well, there's dozens. I'd rather not say exactly."
01:49:42:00,01:49:45:06,But the men trapped underground number almost 3000.
01:49:45:10,01:49:47:08,#NAME?
01:49:47:12,01:49:49:19,#NAME?
01:49:49:23,01:49:52:08,Take out the mercenaries south of Ackerman Park.
01:49:52:11,01:49:55:05,"Blow the rubble, make a hole big enough for 10 at a time."
01:49:55:08,01:49:58:14,I'm in contact with my partner who's down there. They're just waiting.
01:49:58:18,01:50:02:24,- Men who haven't seen daylight in months? - Officers who haven't seen daylight in months.
01:50:03:04,01:50:05:20,What about the bomb? Satellite can't pick up radiation hot spots.
01:50:06:09,01:50:09:18,They keep it on a truck. It must have a lead-lined roof.
01:50:09:22,01:50:12:14,#NAME?
01:50:12:18,01:50:16:02,"Well, it's one of three. We've been tracking it."
01:50:16:11,01:50:17:12,Decoy.
01:50:19:01,01:50:22:11,- You don't really think he's coming back? - Doesn't matter what I think.
01:50:22:15,01:50:26:12,"Actually, it does. You should put your faith in something a little more real."
01:50:26:16,01:50:29:21,- The routes don't vary much - Okay. What about the triggerman?
01:50:30:01,01:50:34:03,No leads. It's a bluff. Bane wouldn't give control of that bomb to someone else.
01:50:34:06,01:50:38:12,"We can't take that chance. Until we have the triggerman, we just track the device."
01:50:38:16,01:50:42:14,"And meanwhile, Gotham lives under a warlord, like some failed state?"
01:50:42:18,01:50:45:15,"Dial it back, officer. This situation is unprecedented."
01:50:45:19,01:50:51:01,- We can't do anything to risk millions of lives. - You gonna tell him what's really going on?
01:50:51:05,01:50:54:07,"Captain, the situation is more complicated than you think."
01:50:54:11,01:50:56:16,There's someone you need to meet.
01:50:56:24,01:51:00:21,Came upstairs looking for a vantage point. Found the people who run the corporation.
01:51:01:01,01:51:02:05,What corporation?
01:51:02:09,01:51:04:18,Wayne Enterprises. You good?
01:51:13:19,01:51:15:24,"Mr. Fox, would you like to brief the captain?"
01:51:16:04,01:51:18:19,Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.
01:51:18:22,01:51:23:10,"And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it."
01:51:23:14,01:51:25:14,#NAME?
01:51:25:18,01:51:27:06,You built the bomb?
01:51:27:10,01:51:31:14,It was built as a fusion reactor. First of its kind.
01:51:31:18,01:51:35:03,Bane turned the core into a bomb and removed it from the reactor.
01:51:35:07,01:51:38:16,- Here's the important part. - As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...
01:51:38:20,01:51:40:18,...it becomes increasingly unstable...
01:51:40:22,01:51:42:11,...to the point of detonation.
01:51:42:15,01:51:44:09,This bomb is a time bomb.
01:51:44:13,01:51:48:13,"And it will go off in 23 days, regardless of Bane's revolution..."
01:51:48:17,01:51:51:10,"...or what we, or the outside world, choose to do."
01:51:51:14,01:51:54:05,So your plan might not be as practical as you thought.
01:51:54:17,01:51:59:05,#NAME?
01:51:59:08,01:52:02:12,- Let's move from this location and call it in. - Right. Let's go.
01:52:02:16,01:52:05:21,"No, no, we'll take it from here. You stay and look after these folks."
01:52:08:12,01:52:10:05,
01:52:10:09,01:52:11:20,
01:52:13:05,01:52:14:11,Someone sold us out.
01:52:16:02,01:52:17:13,"Go, go, go!"
01:52:38:20,01:52:40:23,I'll die before I talk.
01:52:41:15,01:52:43:22,"I'm on your schedule, captain."
01:52:44:02,01:52:45:17,
01:52:50:09,01:52:52:17,There were people living upstairs.
01:52:53:05,01:52:55:08,Round them up forjudgment...
01:52:59:04,01:53:04:01,...and hang them where the world can see.
01:53:06:02,01:53:10:21,Police have cordoned off the entire Central Heights and East Park Side areas...
01:53:11:01,01:53:15:03,...as well as Merchant and South Shoreline Boulevards in an attempt...
01:53:16:15,01:53:18:15,
01:53:18:18,01:53:22:20,He says the leap to freedom is not about strength.
01:53:23:06,01:53:25:06,My body makes the jump.
01:53:25:18,01:53:29:15,Survival is the spirit. The soul.
01:53:32:13,01:53:35:12,My soul is as ready to escape as my body.
01:53:35:16,01:53:38:16,Fear is why you fail.
01:53:38:23,01:53:40:12,"No, I'm not afraid."
01:53:42:04,01:53:43:16,I'm angry.
01:53:46:05,01:53:48:04,
01:54:04:05,01:54:05:20,
01:54:12:22,01:54:14:09,Bruce.
01:54:15:14,01:54:16:16,Why do we fall?
01:54:16:24,01:54:18:22,
01:54:22:17,01:54:24:14,You do not fear death.
01:54:25:15,01:54:30:04,You think this makes you strong. It makes you weak.
01:54:30:17,01:54:31:18,Why?
01:54:31:22,01:54:34:04,How can you move faster than possible...
01:54:34:11,01:54:36:22,...fight longer than possible...
01:54:37:05,01:54:40:19,...without the most powerful impulse of the spirit?
01:54:42:01,01:54:43:16,The fear of death.
01:54:44:09,01:54:46:06,I do fear death.
01:54:48:02,01:54:50:01,I fear dying in here...
01:54:50:20,01:54:52:18,...while my city burns.
01:54:53:19,01:54:55:17,There's no one there to save it.
01:54:57:02,01:54:58:14,Then make the climb.
01:54:58:18,01:55:00:12,
01:55:03:15,01:55:04:23,How?
01:55:06:11,01:55:08:06,As the child did...
01:55:12:23,01:55:14:15,...without the rope.
01:55:17:07,01:55:19:14,Then fear will find you again.
01:55:26:14,01:55:28:20,"Ah, supplies for your journey?"
01:55:29:00,01:55:31:03,"Oh, that's wonderful. That's..."
01:55:33:15,01:55:35:09,
01:55:35:16,01:55:37:07,What does that mean?
01:55:37:20,01:55:39:02,Rise.
01:55:40:10,01:55:41:11,No.
01:56:02:02,01:56:03:18,
01:56:42:05,01:56:44:05,
01:57:11:10,01:57:13:08,"No, there's been a mistake!"
01:57:13:12,01:57:15:12,Take me to Bane!
01:57:18:02,01:57:19:18,I want to see Bane!
01:57:23:00,01:57:24:02,Order!
01:57:24:06,01:57:27:00,This is a mistake! Where is Bane?
01:57:27:04,01:57:29:07,"There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver."
01:57:29:16,01:57:32:03,You are Philip Stryver...
01:57:32:06,01:57:35:19,...executive vice president of Daggett Industries...
01:57:35:23,01:57:39:14,...who for years has been living off the blood and sweat...
01:57:39:18,01:57:41:23,...of people less powerful than him.
01:57:42:03,01:57:45:05,Call Bane. I am one of you.
01:57:45:11,01:57:48:24,Bane has no authority here. This is merely a sentencing hearing.
01:57:49:04,01:57:51:07,"Now, the choice is yours."
01:57:51:11,01:57:53:21,Exile or death!
01:57:54:14,01:57:56:04,
01:57:58:12,01:57:59:22,Order!
01:58:00:12,01:58:01:19,Exi... Exile.
01:58:02:13,01:58:03:23,Sold.
01:58:04:03,01:58:05:21,To the man in the cold sweat.
01:58:13:06,01:58:14:17,You follow the thick ice.
01:58:14:20,01:58:16:24,"You try to swim, you're dead in minutes."
01:58:17:04,01:58:18:18,Has anyone made it?
01:58:32:04,01:58:34:14,Where are they? It's not like we have a lot of time.
01:58:35:01,01:58:36:04,How long?
01:58:36:08,01:58:38:04,The bomb goes off tomorrow.
01:58:38:14,01:58:41:14,- We have about 18 hours to do something. - To do what?
01:58:41:18,01:58:45:18,To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so we can start to figure out how to bring it down.
01:58:52:11,01:58:53:17,That's it?
01:58:56:05,01:58:57:08,Foley.
01:58:58:21,01:59:02:19,"- Where's Foley, damn it? - You shouldn't be out on the streets."
01:59:07:12,01:59:10:10,"- Jim, he's not here. - You let your wife come to the door?"
01:59:10:14,01:59:13:15,"- When the city's under occupation? - Wait in the kitchen, honey."
01:59:13:19,01:59:16:10,"What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard?"
01:59:16:14,01:59:18:17,You saw what they did to those Special Forces.
01:59:18:21,01:59:21:05,Have you forgotten all the years we were out on patrol?
01:59:21:09,01:59:24:12,When every gangbanger wanted to plant one as soon as our backs were turned?
01:59:24:16,01:59:28:19,That was different. These guys run the city. The government's done a deal with them.
01:59:28:23,01:59:31:12,Bane's got their balls in a vice. That's not a deal.
01:59:31:16,01:59:34:23,"You move on Bane, the triggerman is gonna hit the button."
01:59:35:03,01:59:39:03,You think he's given control of that bomb to one of the people?
01:59:39:06,01:59:41:07,You think this is part of some revolution?
01:59:41:11,01:59:44:07,There's one man with his finger on the button. That's Bane.
01:59:44:11,01:59:47:13,"Look, we've all got to keep our heads down till they can fix this."
01:59:47:17,01:59:51:08,#NAME?
01:59:51:12,01:59:53:02,...the city!
01:59:53:10,01:59:55:02,"Look, Peter."
01:59:56:01,02:00:00:15,"I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues, but something has to be done."
02:00:00:19,02:00:02:20,#NAME?
02:00:03:00,02:00:05:04,What goods that gonna do when that thing blows?
02:00:05:08,02:00:07:19,You don't know that's gonna happen.
02:00:09:17,02:00:11:08,
02:00:11:23,02:00:14:06,"I hear you're looking for men, Commissioner."
02:00:14:10,02:00:15:16,How about me instead?
02:00:15:20,02:00:18:11,"Miss Tate, I, uh, can't ask you to do that."
02:00:19:09,02:00:20:11,Please.
02:00:22:01,02:00:24:05,You little punk! What'd you take?
02:00:24:09,02:00:26:16,Nothing! I didn't take anything!
02:00:26:20,02:00:30:03,"You steal from us, you little bastard?"
02:00:30:17,02:00:34:17,"Now, you boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely."
02:00:40:15,02:00:43:21,"Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid."
02:00:50:13,02:00:52:14,You're pretty generous for a thief.
02:01:01:06,02:01:04:01,#NAME?
02:01:04:09,02:01:07:13,"- If you're expecting an apology, I... - It wouldn't suit you."
02:01:08:23,02:01:09:24,I need your help.
02:01:10:13,02:01:11:24,And why would I help you?
02:01:12:04,02:01:14:04,For this. Clean slate.
02:01:14:08,02:01:16:08,You'd trust me with that?
02:01:16:22,02:01:18:13,After what I did to you?
02:01:18:17,02:01:21:15,"I'll admit, I was a little let down."
02:01:23:06,02:01:26:09,"But I still think there's more to you. In fact, I think that for you..."
02:01:26:19,02:01:28:03,...this isn't just a tool.
02:01:28:07,02:01:31:12,It's an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh.
02:01:32:10,02:01:35:09,- I can't even get off this island. - I can give you a way off...
02:01:35:13,02:01:37:02,...once you get me to Lucius Fox.
02:01:37:06,02:01:40:01,Find out where they're holding him and take me in.
02:01:43:19,02:01:44:22,Why do you need Fox?
02:01:45:02,02:01:47:14,#NAME?
02:01:47:18,02:01:49:08,Maybe I like it this way.
02:01:49:12,02:01:51:03,Maybe you do...
02:01:52:12,02:01:54:20,...but tomorrow that bomb's going off.
02:01:57:10,02:01:59:03,Got your powerful friend on the case?
02:01:59:07,02:02:00:15,I'm trying...
02:02:01:11,02:02:03:02,...but I need Fox.
02:02:03:06,02:02:04:24,As it approaches...
02:02:05:19,02:02:06:23,...flip the switch.
02:02:07:03,02:02:10:16,"The needle hits 200, you give me the signal, I'll mark the truck. Okay?"
02:02:12:01,02:02:13:16,"Heads up, heads up."
02:02:29:19,02:02:32:02,- I got it. - Mercenaries on your 6.
02:02:32:06,02:02:35:09,Stand still! Keep your hands where we can see them!
02:02:37:14,02:02:39:15,"Commissioner Gordon, you are under arrest."
02:02:39:19,02:02:41:12,On whose authority?
02:02:41:16,02:02:42:21,The people of Gotham.
02:02:43:21,02:02:48:19,No lawyer? No witnesses? What sort of due process is this?
02:02:48:23,02:02:52:04,"Your guilt has been determined, this is merely a sentencing hearing."
02:02:52:14,02:02:54:04,"Now, what will it be?"
02:02:55:09,02:02:58:02,Death or exile?
02:02:58:06,02:03:03:00,"Crane, if you think we're going out onto that ice willingly..."
02:03:03:04,02:03:04:19,...you have another thing coming.
02:03:07:06,02:03:08:15,"Death, then."
02:03:08:18,02:03:10:24,#NAME?
02:03:11:04,02:03:12:16,Death...
02:03:13:24,02:03:15:17,...by exile.
02:03:15:21,02:03:17:14,
02:03:18:07,02:03:19:18,Bring her to me.
02:03:26:06,02:03:30:11,"Hey, we're going now. Blake says they're ready! Get your gear on!"
02:03:30:15,02:03:33:16,"Hey, you hear me? We're going now. Let's do it."
02:03:37:19,02:03:40:01,"Find this one a spot, got a big day tomorrow."
02:03:40:05,02:03:43:09,We all do. It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.
02:03:45:15,02:03:47:00,#NAME?
02:03:47:04,02:03:49:14,"Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne."
02:03:49:17,02:03:51:10,How long until that core ignites?
02:03:51:14,02:03:55:10,- That bomb goes off in 12 hours. - Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.
02:03:56:04,02:03:59:07,- Can you get Miranda out of here? - Not tonight. I'm sorry.
02:04:00:02,02:04:02:08,- Do what's necessary - Tonight I need you.
02:04:02:12,02:04:04:22,#NAME?
02:04:05:02,02:04:09:06,"Sorry to spoil things, boys, but Bane wants these guys to himself."
02:04:11:14,02:04:14:16,"- I won't forget about you, Miranda. - I know."
02:04:23:23,02:04:25:18,"I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne."
02:04:25:22,02:04:27:19,He should be so lucky.
02:04:33:13,02:04:36:07,Any move I make on Bane or the bomb...
02:04:36:11,02:04:38:08,...the triggerman sets it off.
02:04:38:12,02:04:41:07,"Well, they won't use radio or cell. Too much interference."
02:04:41:11,02:04:43:03,Infrared doesn't have the range.
02:04:43:07,02:04:46:01,It'll have to be a microburst. Longwave.
02:04:46:05,02:04:48:00,#NAME?
02:04:48:04,02:04:51:19,But I'll need the EMP cannon guidance mount from the Bat.
02:04:52:23,02:04:54:14,Remember where you parked?
02:05:08:23,02:05:10:11,She ﬂy okay?
02:05:11:11,02:05:14:05,"Yeah, even without the autopilot."
02:05:14:09,02:05:17:08,- Thanks. - Autopilot? That's what you're there for.
02:05:57:02,02:05:59:21,"Okay. It's clear. Come on, quick. One at a time."
02:06:02:08,02:06:03:10,
02:06:03:19,02:06:05:03,"Wait, wait!"
02:06:06:11,02:06:07:22,Ross!
02:06:08:02,02:06:09:11,Ross?
02:06:10:02,02:06:12:04,#NAME?
02:06:12:20,02:06:14:10,Get down!
02:06:16:01,02:06:17:07,Who are you?
02:06:46:17,02:06:47:24,Light it up.
02:07:05:23,02:07:09:03,#NAME?
02:07:19:13,02:07:21:06,Impossible.
02:07:22:01,02:07:23:19,Keep her close.
02:07:24:11,02:07:26:03,He'll come for her.
02:07:26:11,02:07:28:05,Where's Miranda Tate?
02:07:28:21,02:07:30:08,Bane took her.
02:07:30:13,02:07:33:20,"He's holed up at city hall, surrounded by his army."
02:07:34:03,02:07:36:15,This blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb.
02:07:36:19,02:07:40:11,Get it onto it before sunrise. They might hit the button when it starts.
02:07:41:09,02:07:42:13,When what starts?
02:07:43:01,02:07:44:06,War.
02:07:58:01,02:07:59:06,
02:08:20:03,02:08:21:06,You missed a spot.
02:08:24:20,02:08:29:17,"- If you're working alone, wear a mask. - I'm not afraid to be seen standing up to them."
02:08:29:21,02:08:33:02,The mask is not for you. It's to protect the people you care about.
02:08:34:19,02:08:36:19,"Count to five, then throw."
02:08:36:22,02:08:38:19,
02:08:47:04,02:08:49:20,"No offense, but you got something bigger in that belt?"
02:09:00:06,02:09:03:09,#NAME?
02:09:03:13,02:09:05:19,But you need to get people across the bridge.
02:09:05:23,02:09:08:05,#NAME?
02:09:08:09,02:09:11:02,Lead an exodus. Save as many lives as you can.
02:09:11:06,02:09:12:13,You don't need me here?
02:09:12:17,02:09:14:06,You've given me an army.
02:09:14:10,02:09:15:14,Now go.
02:09:16:08,02:09:17:11,"Hey, thanks."
02:09:17:14,02:09:18:23,Don't thank me yet.
02:09:19:02,02:09:21:04,"Well, I might not get a chance later."
02:09:34:24,02:09:36:17,You shouldn't have.
02:09:37:16,02:09:39:20,The midtown tunnel's blocked by debris...
02:09:39:24,02:09:43:09,...but the cannons have enough firepower to make a path for people.
02:09:43:13,02:09:45:09,Wait until the fighting begins.
02:09:45:13,02:09:48:06,You're gonna wage a war to save your stuck-up girlfriend?
02:09:48:10,02:09:49:11,"To start it, throttle..."
02:09:49:15,02:09:51:02,
02:09:51:06,02:09:54:10,- I got it. - We have 45 minutes to save this city.
02:09:54:14,02:09:57:08,"No, I've got 45 minutes to get clear of the blast radius."
02:09:57:12,02:10:00:19,"- You don't stand a chance against these guys. - With your help, I might."
02:10:00:23,02:10:03:08,"I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone."
02:10:04:10,02:10:06:01,There's more to you than that.
02:10:09:17,02:10:11:19,Sorry to keep letting you down.
02:10:15:11,02:10:16:24,Come with me.
02:10:18:07,02:10:19:21,Save yourself.
02:10:22:03,02:10:24:20,You don't owe these people any more.
02:10:24:24,02:10:27:03,You've given them everything.
02:10:27:07,02:10:28:18,Not everything.
02:10:29:04,02:10:30:10,Not yet.
02:11:10:11,02:11:12:03,Disperse!
02:11:12:07,02:11:14:12,Disperse or be fired upon!
02:11:15:22,02:11:18:07,There's only one police in this town.
02:11:18:23,02:11:20:20,
02:11:57:07,02:11:58:23,Open fire.
02:12:08:09,02:12:10:18,
02:12:50:04,02:12:51:22,- Here it comes! - Get ready!
02:13:21:18,02:13:25:21,So you came back to die with your city.
02:13:26:04,02:13:29:24,No. I came back to stop you.
02:13:41:01,02:13:42:02,Now!
02:13:55:00,02:13:56:15,That's impossible.
02:13:58:12,02:14:00:03,Cut over to Fifth!
02:14:14:04,02:14:16:05,Here you go. Get on the bus. Go ahead.
02:14:16:09,02:14:18:23,"You, come with me. You too."
02:14:19:04,02:14:22:05,"Hey, you, you, and you, come here, come here."
02:14:22:09,02:14:24:05,"Everyone else get on the bus, okay?"
02:14:24:09,02:14:27:01,"You guys, you go knock on doors and spread the word, okay?"
02:14:27:05,02:14:31:02,The bomb is gonna go off. Get out by the South Street tunnel or over the bridge.
02:14:31:06,02:14:33:23,"You do two blocks and you get back to the bus, all right?"
02:14:34:03,02:14:35:24,"Go, go, go!"
02:14:36:04,02:14:37:13,Is he back?
02:14:38:22,02:14:40:06,"Keep your eyes open. Go, go."
02:15:23:07,02:15:25:22,
02:15:44:14,02:15:46:02,
02:16:02:21,02:16:04:10,Cover the doors!
02:16:07:14,02:16:09:03,Where's your trigger?!
02:16:09:11,02:16:11:02,Where is it?!
02:16:12:00,02:16:14:21,You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen!
02:16:15:00,02:16:17:15,Where is it? Where's your trigger?
02:16:17:19,02:16:18:21,
02:16:19:00,02:16:21:18,Where is it?! Where is it?!
02:16:29:13,02:16:31:16,Tell me where the trigger is.
02:16:32:04,02:16:35:18,Then you have my permission to die.
02:16:47:21,02:16:49:14,I broke you.
02:16:50:21,02:16:52:18,How have you come back?
02:16:52:22,02:16:57:10,You think you're the only one who could learn the strength to escape?
02:16:57:14,02:16:58:21,Where's the trigger?
02:16:59:13,02:17:01:22,But I never escaped.
02:17:02:18,02:17:04:08,But the child.
02:17:06:03,02:17:08:04,The child of Ra's Al Ghul made the climb.
02:17:08:08,02:17:10:17,But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.
02:17:10:21,02:17:13:06,
02:17:14:15,02:17:15:23,I am.
02:17:16:10,02:17:18:20,And though I'm not ordinary...
02:17:20:04,02:17:21:21,...I am a citizen.
02:17:41:11,02:17:42:16,Miranda?
02:17:45:13,02:17:46:14,Why?
02:17:47:08,02:17:48:16,Talia.
02:17:49:12,02:17:52:13,"My mother named me Talia, before she was killed..."
02:17:53:09,02:17:56:19,"...the way I would have been killed, if not for my protector..."
02:17:57:06,02:17:58:07,...Bane.
02:18:06:06,02:18:07:10,Goodbye.
02:18:09:16,02:18:11:19,I climbed out of the pit.
02:18:17:18,02:18:19:13,I found my father...
02:18:22:12,02:18:25:15,...and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance.
02:18:26:12,02:18:28:07,But by that time...
02:18:29:10,02:18:33:04,...the prisoners and doctor had done their work to my friend.
02:18:33:08,02:18:34:13,My protector.
02:18:38:13,02:18:40:01,The League took us in.
02:18:40:10,02:18:41:23,Trained us.
02:18:42:08,02:18:45:03,But my father could not accept Bane.
02:18:45:16,02:18:47:10,He saw only a monster.
02:18:47:14,02:18:53:11,His very existence was a reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in.
02:18:53:21,02:18:57:00,He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows.
02:18:57:04,02:19:01:17,His only crime was that he loved me.
02:19:03:12,02:19:06:11,I could not forgive my father.
02:19:11:02,02:19:12:18,Until you murdered him.
02:19:16:09,02:19:17:23,
02:19:30:14,02:19:36:01,He was trying to kill millions of innocent people.
02:19:36:08,02:19:39:23,"Innocent is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce."
02:19:42:14,02:19:45:15,I honor my father by finishing his work.
02:19:57:20,02:20:02:17,Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience.
02:20:04:05,02:20:05:07,You see...
02:20:06:20,02:20:08:04,...it's the slow knife...
02:20:08:08,02:20:10:23,...the knife that takes its time.
02:20:14:18,02:20:15:23,The knife...
02:20:16:19,02:20:20:09,...that waits years without forgetting...
02:20:20:16,02:20:23:23,...then slips quietly between the bones.
02:20:25:00,02:20:26:07,That's the knife...
02:20:27:15,02:20:28:24,...that cuts deepest.
02:20:29:03,02:20:30:06,Please.
02:20:30:15,02:20:32:12,
02:20:37:24,02:20:39:24,Maybe your knife...
02:20:40:24,02:20:42:10,...was too slow.
02:20:42:14,02:20:43:24,The truck is under attack.
02:20:44:04,02:20:47:22,Gordon. You gave him a way to block my signal.
02:20:48:02,02:20:49:03,No matter.
02:20:49:07,02:20:51:02,
02:20:51:16,02:20:53:18,He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.
02:20:54:00,02:20:55:23,
02:20:58:03,02:20:59:15,Come on!
02:21:00:06,02:21:01:16,This Way!
02:21:07:06,02:21:09:16,Stay there! What are you doing?
02:21:10:03,02:21:13:12,"Blake, MCU! I'm getting these boys to safety!"
02:21:13:16,02:21:14:24,You'll get us all killed!
02:21:15:04,02:21:18:04,"If anyone crosses this bridge, they'll blow the city!"
02:21:18:08,02:21:21:17,"It's gonna blow anyway! We need to open this bridge, now!"
02:21:21:21,02:21:25:01,"Detective, if you take one step forward we will shoot you!"
02:21:25:05,02:21:28:19,"If you take two steps forward, we will blow the bridge!"
02:21:30:21,02:21:34:04,"Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me, all right? Go back and wait."
02:21:37:10,02:21:41:09,Prepare a convoy. We must secure the bomb until it detonates.
02:21:42:17,02:21:46:11,"Don't kill him, I want him to feel the heat."
02:21:47:04,02:21:52:01,Feel the fire of 12 million souls you failed.
02:21:57:24,02:21:59:13,"Goodbye, my friend."
02:22:07:15,02:22:08:24,Goodbye.
02:22:09:13,02:22:13:01,Keep moving forward! Flank them at the stairs!
02:22:21:06,02:22:23:00,Shoot them.
02:22:23:16,02:22:25:03,Shoot them all.
02:22:25:07,02:22:26:16,
02:22:34:08,02:22:37:24,We both know that I have to kill you now.
02:22:40:22,02:22:43:03,You'll just have to imagine the fire.
02:22:47:08,02:22:49:03,
02:22:50:23,02:22:53:00,About the whole no-guns thing...
02:22:53:23,02:22:57:00,...I'm not sure I feel as strongly about it as you do.
02:23:10:09,02:23:12:00,Pull up.
02:23:14:17,02:23:16:04,Stay level.
02:23:28:13,02:23:31:20,We have to force that convoy east to the entrance to the reactor.
02:23:33:16,02:23:36:16,"I need you on the ground, I'll be in the air. Go."
02:23:36:22,02:23:40:04,The situation has changed. Your orders are out of date.
02:23:40:21,02:23:44:08,"I'm a cop, like you, and I'm walking out there."
02:23:45:04,02:23:47:06,Please do not shoot me!
02:23:49:05,02:23:50:08,Shoot at his feet.
02:24:00:09,02:24:02:17,Nothing like a little air superiority.
02:24:02:21,02:24:04:23,Detective! Please stop!
02:24:05:13,02:24:08:15,"Please, detective! Stop!"
02:24:08:19,02:24:10:15,Stop walking!
02:24:11:12,02:24:14:05,Blow it! Do it!
02:24:25:12,02:24:27:21,You have to get that bomb here. You've got 10 minutes.
02:24:38:20,02:24:41:04,They're pushing us to the entrance of the reactor.
02:24:41:07,02:24:43:19,They're gonna try to reconnect the core.
02:24:45:02,02:24:46:15,You idiots!
02:24:46:22,02:24:48:17,You sons of bitches!
02:24:48:21,02:24:50:15,You're killing us!
02:24:50:19,02:24:52:10,"Yeah, follow your orders!"
02:24:52:19,02:24:55:02,"All right, boys. Get in a circle. Bow your heads."
02:24:57:24,02:24:59:19,It's on my side.
02:25:36:09,02:25:38:01,
02:25:44:14,02:25:46:01,
02:25:47:18,02:25:50:21,"Hey, Father! Let's get everyone back on the bus, okay? Go, go, go!"
02:25:51:01,02:25:54:05,- Back on the bus! - There's nowhere to go.
02:25:54:18,02:25:55:19,On the bus!
02:26:52:17,02:26:54:20,You've got to turn the truck east!
02:26:59:18,02:27:01:12,Stay straight!
02:27:13:01,02:27:14:09,
02:27:33:06,02:27:36:15,Give me a hand! We can get a cable on it!
02:27:43:09,02:27:46:05,Fox showed me how to override the reactor.
02:27:49:23,02:27:51:05,"Oh, dear."
02:27:51:14,02:27:53:16,
02:27:54:22,02:27:58:06,Including the emergency flood.
02:28:14:16,02:28:16:14,There's no way...
02:28:17:12,02:28:18:18,...this bomb...
02:28:19:15,02:28:21:04,...will be stopped.
02:28:22:09,02:28:23:12,What are you doing?
02:28:23:16,02:28:26:01,Protection from the blast. We're gonna be all right!
02:28:26:05,02:28:27:12,It's an atom bomb!
02:28:27:16,02:28:30:08,Think they need to hear that? Let them die without hope? Come on!
02:28:31:06,02:28:32:22,Prepare yourselves.
02:28:34:15,02:28:36:16,My father's work...
02:28:37:22,02:28:39:14,...is done.
02:28:45:09,02:28:48:08,- What are you doing? - I can get it out over the bay!
02:28:48:18,02:28:50:24,"Set it to fly out over the water, then eject?"
02:28:51:03,02:28:52:19,No autopilot.
02:28:54:10,02:28:57:19,"You could've gone anywhere, been anything. But you came back here."
02:28:57:23,02:28:59:02,So did you.
02:28:59:13,02:29:01:14,I guess we're both suckers.
02:29:09:06,02:29:12:02,#NAME?
02:29:12:06,02:29:14:20,Shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them?
02:29:15:00,02:29:16:04,A hero can be anyone.
02:29:16:08,02:29:19:06,Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring...
02:29:19:10,02:29:23:07,...as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know...
02:29:23:11,02:29:25:06,...the world hadn't ended.
02:29:42:24,02:29:44:11,Bruce Wayne?
02:29:57:13,02:30:00:16,"Come on! There you go! Okay, you too. Come on, Father."
02:30:19:23,02:30:21:20,"Hey, heads down! This is it!"
02:30:22:04,02:30:25:02,"- No. - No, that's Batman!"
02:31:04:22,02:31:06:24,
02:31:13:07,02:31:14:14,That's detonation!
02:31:22:01,02:31:23:23,It's out over the bay! Clear of the city!
02:31:24:04,02:31:26:14,
02:31:43:20,02:31:46:16,"""I see a beautiful city..."
02:31:46:20,02:31:48:23,...and a brilliant people...
02:31:49:05,02:31:51:05,...rising from this abyss.
02:31:52:10,02:31:56:10,I see the lives for which I lay down my life...
02:31:56:20,02:31:58:01,...peaceful...
02:31:58:19,02:32:02:01,"...useful, prosperous and happy."
02:32:04:12,02:32:08:03,I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts...
02:32:09:23,02:32:13:03,...and in the hearts of their descendants...
02:32:13:23,02:32:15:17,...generations hence.
02:32:18:09,02:32:22:15,"It is a far, far better thing that I do..."
02:32:23:12,02:32:25:11,...than I have ever done.
02:32:26:12,02:32:30:24,"It is a far, far better rest that I go to..."
02:32:33:22,02:32:35:15,"...than I have ever known."""
02:32:51:00,02:32:53:04,
02:32:53:23,02:32:55:09,I'm so sorry.
02:32:55:18,02:32:57:12,I failed you.
02:32:59:12,02:33:01:03,You trusted me...
02:33:02:18,02:33:03:21,...and I failed you.
02:33:07:24,02:33:09:19,Can I change your mind...
02:33:12:03,02:33:14:01,...about quitting the force?
02:33:14:23,02:33:18:19,You know what you said about structures becoming shackles?
02:33:19:04,02:33:22:17,"You were right, and I can't take it. The injustice."
02:33:22:22,02:33:27:05,"I mean, no one's ever gonna know who saved an entire city."
02:33:27:10,02:33:28:12,They know.
02:33:30:10,02:33:32:03,It was the Batman.
02:33:50:05,02:33:53:19,Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to reflect his more modest estate.
02:33:53:23,02:33:57:19,"Nonetheless, there are considerable assets to dispose of."
02:33:57:23,02:34:01:10,The contents of the house are to be sold to settle the estate's accounts...
02:34:01:14,02:34:05:22,...and the remainder is left in its entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.
02:34:07:09,02:34:12:06,The house and grounds are left to the city of Gotham on condition that...
02:34:12:10,02:34:16:04,"...they never be demolished, altered or otherwise interfered with..."
02:34:16:07,02:34:20:02,"...and that they shall be used for one purpose, and one purpose only:"
02:34:21:18,02:34:26:01,The housing and care of the city's at-risk and orphaned children.
02:34:26:15,02:34:31:02,My clerk can help with the smaller correspondences and instructions.
02:34:31:06,02:34:32:16,"Blake, John."
02:34:32:23,02:34:36:05,#NAME?
02:34:39:15,02:34:42:10,You should use your full name. I like that name.
02:34:42:14,02:34:44:11,#NAME?
02:34:44:15,02:34:46:19,Why worry about the stabilization software?
02:34:46:23,02:34:48:23,This entire autopilot system's completely obsolete.
02:34:49:03,02:34:52:22,"Please, I just need to know what I could've done to fix it."
02:34:53:02,02:34:57:05,"But, Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed. Software patch. Six months ago."
02:34:57:09,02:34:58:23,Check the ID on the patch.
02:35:02:01,02:35:03:16,Bruce Wayne.
02:35:04:12,02:35:06:20,#NAME?
02:35:06:23,02:35:08:10,They better leave no stone unturned.
02:35:08:14,02:35:11:24,We can't leave a string of pearls on the manifest as lost.
