1
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,319
If you please, ma'am!

2
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:12,031
There are two gentlemen and a lady
waiting upon you in the parlor.

3
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,784
One of the gentlemen is Mr. Darcy.

4
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,081
Thank you. Tell them I shall come directly.

5
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,885
Mr. Darcy.

6
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,935
- I hope that you have not been waiting long.
- Not at all.

7
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:45,523
May I introduce my sister Georgiana?

8
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,489
Georgiana, this is Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

9
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:59,453
- How do you do?
- I'm very pleased to meet you, Miss Darcy.

10
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,414
- I've heard so much about you.
- And I about you.

11
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,795
Mr. Bingley is here with us, and very desirous to
see you as well. He insisted on accompanying us.

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,298
- May I summon him?
- Of course! I should like to see him very much.

13
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:22,601
I understand that you are fond of music,
and play very well.

14
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,521
Oh, no. Not play very well.

15
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:31,610
I mean, but I am very fond of music.
I should dearly love to hear you play and sing.

16
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:36,574
My brother has told me he has rarely heard
anything that gave him more pleasure.

17
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:43,247
Well, you shall. But I warn you, your brother
has grossly exaggerated my talents.

18
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:48,878
- No doubt for some mischievous reason.
- Oh, no. That could not be so.

19
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:52,715
My brother never exaggerates.
He always tells the absolute truth.

20
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,595
Except that sometimes I think
he is a little too kind to me.

21
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,392
- An ideal elder brother, then.
- Yes! I could not imagine a better or a kinder one.

22
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:09,064
You make me feel quite envious.
I have no brothers at all. Only four sisters.

23
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,192
I should have liked to have a sister.

24
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,070
Miss Bennet!

25
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:19,950
I can't tell you how delighted I was when Darcy
told me you were not five miles from Pemberley!

26
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,452
How do you do?

27
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,289
- But I can see that you are well.
- Very well, thank you.

28
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:29,793
- Good, good, excellent! And your family?
- Very well, sir.

29
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,253
Yes?

30
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,842
Pray, tell me. Are all your sisters
still at Longbourn?

31
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,096
All except one.
My youngest sister is at Brighton.

32
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,681
Ah.

33
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,437
It seems too long...

34
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,941
It is too long since I had the pleasure
of speaking to you.

35
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:56,695
- It must be several months.
- It is above eight months at least.

36
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,408
We have not met since the 26th of November,
when we were dancing together at Netherfield.

37
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,203
- I think you must be right.
- Do you know...

38
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't think I can remember a happier time
than those short months I spent in Hertfordshire.

39
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:14,880
Miss Bennet, my sister has a request
to make of you.

40
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:21,720
Miss Bennet,
my brother and I would be honored

41
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:26,892
if you and your aunt and uncle
would be our guests at Pemberley for dinner.

42
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:31,981
- Would tomorrow evening be convenient?
- Thank you. We shall be delighted.

43
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:37,027
I can answer for Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.
We have no fixed engagements.

44
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:43,033
- And shall we hear you play?
- If you insist upon it, yes, you shall.

45
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,831
Absolutely marvelous!

46
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,590
Will you not play again?
You played that song so beautifully.

47
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,343
Not very beautifully, not faithfully at all.

48
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:48,098
You must have seen how I fudged and slurred
my way through the difficult passages.

49
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,728
- It's a beautiful instrument, though.
- My brother gave it to me.

50
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:57,983
- He is so good. I don't deserve it.
- I am sure you do.

51
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:03,530
Your brother thinks you do,
and as you know, he is never wrong.

52
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:11,622
Now, it's your turn. Oh, I absolutely insist!

53
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:16,710
In front of all these people?
I will play, but please don't make me sing.

54
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,379
If you like.

55
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,721
Pray, Miss Eliza, are the militia
still quartered at Meryton?

56
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,724
No, they are encamped at Brighton
for the summer.

57
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,272
- That must be a great loss for your family.
- We are enduring it as best we can, Miss Bingley.

58
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:42,903
I should have thought one gentleman's absence
might have caused particular pangs.

59
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,199
I can't imagine who you mean.

60
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:53,831
I understood that certain ladies found
the society of Mr. Wickham curiously agreeable.

61
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:01,588
I'm so sorry. I'm neglecting you.
How can you play with no one to turn the pages?

62
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,927
There. Allow me.

63
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,606
How very ill Eliza Bennet looked this evening.

64
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,818
I've never in my life seen anyone so much altered
as she is since the winter.

65
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,989
- Quite so, my dear.
- She is grown so brown and coarse.

66
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:14,411
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should
hardly know her. What do you say, Mr. Darcy?

67
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,830
I noticed no great difference.

68
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,793
She is, I suppose, a little tanned.
Hardly surprising when one travels in the summer.

69
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:26,507
For my part, I must confess,
I never saw any beauty in her face.

70
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:31,178
Her features are not at all handsome.
Her complexion has no brilliancy.

71
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,348
Her teeth are tolerable, I suppose,

72
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,892
but nothing out of the common way.

73
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:42,731
And as for her eyes,
which I have sometimes heard called fine,

74
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,527
I could never perceive anything
extraordinary in them.

75
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,326
And in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which I find intolerable.

76
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,411
I think...

77
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:01,833
When we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how
amazed we all were to find her a reputed beauty!

78
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,422
I particularly recall you, Mr. Darcy, one night
after they had been dining at Netherfield,

79
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:13,220
saying, "She a beauty?
I should as soon call her mother a wit!"

80
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,850
But afterwards she seemed
to improve on you.

81
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,354
I even believe you thought her
rather pretty at one time.

82
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:27,651
Yes, I did.
That was only when I first knew her.

83
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:33,115
For many months now I have considered her one
of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.

84
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,801
No, no, the green one.

85
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,721
Yes, that will do.

86
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,726
Good. No, never mind that.

87
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:12,923
- If you please, ma'am. The post's just come.
- Thank you, Hannah.

88
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,844
A good girl, that. Very obliging.

89
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:23,266
Two letters from Jane. At last!
I had been wondering why we hadn't...

90
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:29,523
This one was misdirected at first. No wonder,
for she wrote the direction very ill indeed.

91
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,819
Would you be angry if I beg you
to postpone our outing?

92
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:37,406
Not at all!
Of course you want to read your letters.

93
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,243
Your uncle and I will walk to the church
and call back in an hour.

94
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,370
Thank you, you're very kind.

95
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:05,475
My dearest Lizzy, I hope your journey
has been as delightful as you anticipated.

96
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,312
We all miss you.
Our father most of all, I believe.

97
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:14,568
I have hardly had time to write. My nephews
and nieces have taken almost every moment!

98
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,404
But they are such dear children.

99
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,783
Our mother indeed finds their exuberance
a little trying for her nerves.

100
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,411
Mama...

101
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:29,291
She spends much of the day above stairs
in her room or with Mrs. Philips.

102
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,084
Dearest Lizzy,

103
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:36,423
since writing the above, something has occurred
of a most unexpected and serious nature.

104
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,886
But I'm afraid of alarming you.
Be assured we are all well.

105
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,473
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.

106
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,932
Lydia!

107
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,856
An express came at twelve last night,
just as we were all gone to bed.

108
00:12:55,442 --> 00:13:00,572
Mr. Bennet, what is it?
Are we to be murdered in our beds?

109
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,502
The letter was from Colonel Forster,

110
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:18,089
to inform us that Lydia was gone off
to Scotland with one of his officers.

111
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,384
To own the truth...with Wickham.

112
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,387
Oh, Lydia!

113
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:29,059
Oh, Mr. Bennet, we are all ruined!

114
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,395
You will imagine our surprise and shock.

115
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:36,149
To Kitty, however, it does not seem
so wholly unexpected.

116
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:44,616
I am very, very sorry.
So imprudent a match on both sides!

117
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,912
But I am willing to hope the best and that
his character has been misunderstood.

118
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,956
I wish I could believe it.

119
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,840
His choice is disinterested at least. He must
know that our father can give him nothing.

120
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,675
Yes, that is true.

121
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,386
But how could he do this?

122
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,556
She is silly enough for anything.

123
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:14,396
But Wickham love Lydia? Marry Lydia?

124
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,692
There is one lady I shall be very loath
to part from.

125
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,535
We expect them soon returned from Gretna,
man and wife.

126
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,497
I must conclude.
I cannot be away from our poor mother long.

127
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,083
I shall write again as soon as I have news.

128
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:43,216
My dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what to write,
but I have bad news!

129
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,929
Imprudent as a marriage would be,
we now fear worse:

130
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:53,351
that it has not taken place, that Wickham
never intended to marry Lydia at all!

131
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,104
Great God, I knew it!

132
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,231
I cannot think so ill of him.

133
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,277
I can. Poor Lydia.

134
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,238
Poor stupid girl!

135
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,869
Colonel Forster said he feared
that Wickham was not to be trusted.

136
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,748
She was then but fifteen years old.

137
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:21,463
They were traced as far as Clapham. Father has
gone with Colonel Forster to try to discover them.

138
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,635
I cannot help but beg you all
to come here as soon as possible!

139
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,221
Oh, yes! Where is my uncle?

140
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,728
If you please, ma'am.

141
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:43,068
- Miss Bennet, I hope this...
- I beg your pardon. I must find Mr. Gardiner.

142
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:48,073
- On business that cannot be delayed.
- Good God! What is the matter?

143
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:54,996
Of course I will not detain you, but let me go, or
let the servant go and fetch Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.

144
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,457
- You cannot go yourself.
- I must...

145
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,086
Come. I insist. This will be for the best.
Hello there!

146
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,506
Have Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner
fetched here at once.

147
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,384
- They walked in the direction of...
- The church.

148
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,636
Yes, sir, at once.

149
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:19,312
- You are not well. May I not call a doctor?
- No. lam well. lam well.

150
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,316
Is there nothing you can take
for your present relief?

151
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:28,571
A glass of wine? Can I get you one?
Truly, you look very ill.

152
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:33,994
No, I thank you. There is nothing
the matter with me. I am quite well.

153
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:39,833
I am only distressed by some dreadful news,
which I have just received from Longbourn.

154
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,757
- I am sorry. Forgive me.
- No, no.

155
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:54,180
I have just received a letter from Jane
with such dreadful news.

156
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,517
It cannot be concealed from anyone.

157
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,149
My youngest sister has left all her friends...

158
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,318
has eloped...

159
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,906
has thrown herself into the power...

160
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,701
of Mr. Wickham.

161
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:23,835
They have run away together from Brighton.
You know him too well to doubt the rest.

162
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:30,508
She has no money, no connections,
nothing that can tempt him.

163
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,473
When I think that I might have prevented it!

164
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,893
I, who knew what he was!

165
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:44,064
Had his character been known,
this could not have happened.

166
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,317
But it is all too late now.

167
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,738
I am grieved, indeed. Grieved, shocked.

168
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,951
- But is it certain? Absolutely certain?
- Oh, yes.

169
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,289
They left Brighton together on Sunday night.

170
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,293
They were traced as far as London,
but not beyond.

171
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:11,424
- They are certainly not gone to Scotland.
- What has been attempted to recover her?

172
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,594
My father has gone to London.

173
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,264
And Jane writes to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance.

174
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,145
I hope that we shall leave within half an hour.
But what can be done?

175
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,357
I know very well that nothing can be done.

176
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,654
How is such a man to be worked on?

177
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,949
How are they even to be discovered?

178
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,537
I have not the smallest hope.

179
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:47,627
She is lost forever, and our whole family
must partake of her ruin and disgrace.

180
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,219
I'm afraid you have long been
desiring my absence.

181
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,766
This unfortunate affair will, I fear,

182
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,937
prevent my sister from having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley today.

183
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,982
Oh, yes.

184
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,903
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.

185
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:19,159
Say that urgent business
calls us home immediately.

186
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:25,582
And if you would be so kind...as to conceal
the unhappy truth as long as possible.

187
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,836
I know that it cannot be long.

188
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,006
You may be assured of my secrecy.

189
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:38,219
But I have stayed too long.
I shall leave you now.

190
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,306
Yes. Thank you.

191
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,104
Good bye.

192
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,951
I shall never see him again.

193
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:15,632
Even if what you say of Wickham is true,
I still cannot believe this of Lydia.

194
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:22,138
Ever since the militia came to Meryton, there's
been nothing but love and officers in her head.

195
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:27,477
We must not assume the worst.
It may yet be that this is all a misunderstanding.

196
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:32,649
Or just a passing folly that her friends
can hush up and will in time be quite forgotten.

197
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,111
- It is possible, Lizzy!
- Indeed it is.

198
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:42,617
Why would any young man form a design against
a girl who is not unprotected or friendless,

199
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,286
and who is staying in the Colonel's family?

200
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,750
Look at it in any way you like.
The temptation is not worth the risk.

201
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,046
Not perhaps of risking his own interest.

202
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,925
But I do believe him capable
of risking everything else!

203
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,532
You are very quiet this evening, Mr. Darcy.

204
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:26,619
I sincerely hope you're not pining for the loss
of Miss Eliza Bennet.

205
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,079
What?

206
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,291
Excuse me.

207
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:04,824
There she is!
Mamma, mamma! Did you bring us anything?

208
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,958
- Lizzy! I am so glad to see you.
- Has anything been heard?

209
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,378
Not yet, but now that our uncle has come,
I hope all will be well.

210
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,884
Father left for town on Tuesday,
and we've only heard that he has arrived in safety.

211
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,012
Mamma has been asking for you
every five minutes.

212
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,015
- How is she?
- She has not yet left her room.

213
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:35,730
And you look pale.
Oh, Jane, how much you must have gone through!

214
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,359
I am so happy to see you, Lizzy. Come.

215
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,072
Oh!

216
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,075
Oh, Lizzy!

217
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,951
Oh, brother!

218
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:53,122
We are all ruined forever!

219
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:59,212
If only Mr. Bennet had taken us all to Brighton,
none of this would have happened!

220
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:05,551
I blame those Forsters! I am sure there was
some great neglect on their part,

221
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:11,516
for she is not the kind of girl to do that sort
of thing, if she had been properly looked after!

222
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:15,269
- Mamma.
- And now here is Mr. Bennet gone away.

223
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:20,566
I know he will fight Wickham, and then he will
be killed, and then what is to become of us all?

224
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:27,281
Those Collinses will turn us out
before he is cold in his grave.

225
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:31,828
And if you are not kind to us, brother,
I don't know what we shall do!

226
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:36,082
Sister, calm down.
Nothing dreadful will happen.

227
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:40,670
I'll be in London tomorrow,
and we will consult as to what is to be done.

228
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,297
Yes, yes, that is it!

229
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:47,301
You must find them out, and if
they be not married, you must make them marry.

230
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,555
Above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting!

231
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,476
- Mamma, I am sure he does not mean to fight.
- Oh yes, he does!

232
00:23:55,601 --> 00:24:00,481
And Wickham will kill him for sure,
unless you can prevent it, brother.

233
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,984
You must tell him what a dreadful state I'm in!

234
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:08,156
How I have such tremblings and flutterings
all over me.

235
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:13,161
Such spasms in my side and pains in my head
and beatings at my heart,

236
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:16,497
that I can get no rest either night or day!

237
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,666
Sister, calm yourself.

238
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:23,754
And tell Lydia not to give any directions
about wedding clothes till she's seen me,

239
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,175
for she does not know
which are the best warehouses!

240
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,209
This is the most unfortunate affair
and will probably be much talked of.

241
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:05,838
Yes, thank you, Mary.
I think we have all apprehended that much.

242
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,549
We must stern the tide of malice,

243
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:13,804
and pour into each other's wounded bosoms
the balm of sisterly consolation.

244
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:18,059
- Mary, pass the potatoes to your Aunt Gardiner.
- I beg your pardon?

245
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,894
Never mind. I will.

246
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,105
Thank you, Kitty.

247
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:27,985
That's the first kind word I've had from anyone
since Lydia went away.

248
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,240
It is most unfair, for it is not
as if I have done anything naughty!

249
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,409
And I don't see that Lydia has done
anything dreadful either.

250
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:39,330
- Kitty, please!
- Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia,

251
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:45,753
we must draw from it this useful lesson:
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable.

252
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,589
My dear Mary, this is hardly helpful.

253
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,760
For a woman's reputation
is no less brittle than it is beautiful.

254
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,973
Therefore we cannot be too guarded
in our behavior

255
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,934
towards the undeserving of the other sex.

256
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,061
Yes... Thank you, Mary.

257
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:24,709
Now, Jane...tell me everything about it
that I have not already heard.

258
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,630
What did Colonel Forster say?

259
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,718
Had they no apprehension about anything
before the elopement took place?

260
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:38,973
Colonel Forster did own he suspected
some partiality on Lydia's side,

261
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,601
but nothing to give him any alarm.

262
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,812
Lizzy, I feel I am to blame.

263
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:51,777
I urged you not to make Wickham's bad conduct
known. Now poor Lydia is suffering for it.

264
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:56,616
No one else suspected him for a moment.
lam... lam to blame.

265
00:26:56,741 --> 00:27:03,331
You are not to blame! No more than I, or Mr. Darcy
or anyone else deceived by Wickham.

266
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:09,462
You have nothing to blame yourself for.
Others are culpable, not you.

267
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:15,968
She wrote a note for Mrs. Forster
before she went away.

268
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:26,312
"My dear Harriet, you will laugh
when you know where I am gone,

269
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:32,109
"and I can't help laughing myself at your surprise
tomorrow morning as soon as I am missed."

270
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:38,532
I'm going to Gretna Green, and if you
can't guess with who, I'll think you a simpleton,

271
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:44,205
for there is but one man in the world I love.
Don't send them word at Longbourn of my going.

272
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,460
It will make the surprise all the greater, when I
write to them and sign my name Lydia Wickham!

273
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,964
What a good joke it will be.
I can scarcely write for laughing!

274
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:03,557
Thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!
What a letter to have written at such a moment.

275
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,395
But at least she believed Wickham's purpose
was marriage,

276
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,231
whatever he persuaded her to do afterwards.

277
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,776
Our poor father! How he must have felt it.

278
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,530
I never saw anyone so shocked.

279
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:24,537
He couldn't speak for ten minutes. Mother was
in hysterics, and the house was in confusion.

280
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,874
Lady Lucas has been very kind,
offering her services.

281
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:35,423
She had better had stayed home! Assistance
is impossible, and condolence insufferable.

282
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,759
Let her triumph over us at a distance
and be satisfied!

283
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,720
That is unkind.

284
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:46,934
- I am sure she meant well.
- Yes, perhaps she did.

285
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,107
I am sorry. It's just that I can't help but be...

286
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,611
Oh, Jane.

287
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:03,909
Jane, do you not see that more things have been
ruined by this business than Lydia's reputation?

288
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:31,729
I have stayed too long. I shall leave you now.

289
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,155
Come in.

290
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,201
I thought you would not be in bed yet.

291
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:59,340
I have been thinking about
what you said this afternoon.

292
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:03,385
That it is not only Lydia's reputation
that has been ruined.

293
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:10,017
I was angry and upset. I should not have said it.
It does no good to dwell on it.

294
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,354
You meant, I suppose, that you and I,

295
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:18,442
and Mary and Kitty,
have been tainted by association.

296
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:24,615
That our chances of making a good marriage have
been materially damaged by Lydia's disgrace.

297
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:32,248
The chances of any of us making a good marriage
were never very great.

298
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,710
And now I should say, they are non-existent.

299
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,591
No one will solicit our society after this.
Mr. Darcy made that very clear to me.

300
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,635
Mr. Darcy?

301
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,638
Does he know our troubles?

302
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,353
He happened upon me
a moment after I first read your letter.

303
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,441
He was very kind, very gentleman-like...

304
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,114
but he made it very clear he wanted
nothing more than to be out of my sight.

305
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,663
He will not be renewing his addresses to me.

306
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,000
He'll make very sure his friend
does not renew his to you.

307
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:21,797
I never expected Mr. Bingley would renew
his addresses. I am quite reconciled to that.

308
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,844
Surely you do not desire
Mr. Darcy's attentions, do you?

309
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,180
No, no. I never sought them.

310
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,976
But you do think
he was intending to renew them?

311
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:39,356
- You think he is still in love with you?
- I don't know.

312
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,902
I don't know what he was two days ago.

313
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:49,825
All I know is that now he, or any other respectable
man, will want nothing to do with any of us.

314
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,059
Lord! Look who's coming!

315
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,603
- Who is it, Kitty?
- Mr. Collins, of course.

316
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:21,190
I'm not going to sit with him for anyone.

317
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:36,997
I had hoped to condole
with your poor father and your mother.

318
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:42,002
Father is still in London, sir, and our mother
is not yet well enough to leave her room.

319
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,130
Ah. Ah.

320
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:54,848
I feel myself called on, not only by our
relationship, but by my situation as a clergyman,

321
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:59,645
to condole with you all on the grievous affliction
you are now suffering under.

322
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,022
Thank you, sir.

323
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:07,486
It has often been said
that a friend in need is a friend indeed, sir.

324
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,447
Yes.

325
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:17,538
Be assured, ladies, that Mrs. Collins and myself
sincerely sympathize with you in your distress,

326
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:24,086
which must be of the bitterest kind, proceeding
from a cause which no time can remove.

327
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:28,674
The death of your sister would have been
a blessing in comparison.

328
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,721
And it is more to be lamented,
because there is reason to suppose,

329
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,098
my dear Charlotte informs me,

330
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,560
that this licentiousness of behavior in your sister

331
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:43,105
has proceeded from
a faulty degree of indulgence,

332
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:48,360
though I am inclined to think
that her disposition must be naturally bad.

333
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:53,615
Now, howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied...

334
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,996
We are very grateful, sir, for your...

335
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:04,001
In which opinion I am joined
by Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her daughter,

336
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:07,254
to whom I have related the affair in full.

337
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:12,426
They agree with me in apprehending
that this false step in one sister

338
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,764
must be injurious to the fortunes of all the others.

339
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:22,144
"For who", as Lady Catherine herself
condescendingly says,

340
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:26,231
"will connect themselves with such a family?"

341
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,406
Who indeed, sir?

342
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:39,536
Now, perhaps, in view of that consideration,

343
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:43,082
you may feel that it would be unwise
for you to stay any longer.

344
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,629
Well, perhaps you are right.

345
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,381
Yes, perhaps you are right, cousin Elizabeth.

346
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,761
I always feel that a clergyman
cannot be too careful.

347
00:34:56,512 --> 00:35:03,018
Especially one so fortunate as to enjoy the
condescension and patronage of Lady Catherine.

348
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,898
Your thoughtfulness does you credit,
cousin Elizabeth.

349
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:16,698
I am very, very sorry for you all.

350
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:34,174
- Insufferable man!
- I suppose he means well.

351
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,176
You suppose wrongly, Jane.

352
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,765
His purpose was to enjoy our misfortunes and
congratulate himself on his own happy situation!

353
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,768
I think it very kind of him
to visit and condole with us.

354
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,234
Is he gone?

355
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,778
Yes.

356
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,698
- Good.
- Forever with any luck.

357
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:01,451
Here's Aunt Philips.
She can tell us the news from Meryton.

358
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:05,664
- I doubt there's much we'd care to hear.
- Mother will be pleased to see her.

359
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,752
Well, girls, here's a to-do.

360
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:14,923
- Does your mother still keep to her bed?
- No, but she keeps to her room.

361
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:19,887
Well, well, the less the servants hear
the better, I dare say.

362
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:24,975
Come, let me to her, Jane, though heaven knows
I have no glad tidings for her.

363
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:31,732
Not a day goes by but I hear some new bad tale
of Mr. Wickham.

364
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:36,153
Oh, Mr. Wickham,
that everybody praised to the skies!

365
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:40,991
Mr. Wickham, that half the town
was mad in love with. All the time a villain!

366
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,204
A very demon from hell sent to ruin us.

367
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,918
I have heard he's run up debts
with every reputable tradesman in the town.

368
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,419
Oh, sister!

369
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,839
- I have heard tales of gaming debts.
- Oh, sister.

370
00:36:55,964 --> 00:37:01,803
Of drunken routs, in which more things were
broken beyond repair than heads and furniture.

371
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,597
Oh, sister, stop!

372
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:07,309
Debauches, intrigues, seductions!

373
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,898
They say there's hardly a tradesman in the town
whose daughters were not meddled with!

374
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,694
Now he's meddling with our dearest girl.
The foul fiend!

375
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,739
He shall be discovered and made to marry her.

376
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:29,122
I have to say, sister, that I always distrusted
his appearance of goodness.

377
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:33,335
Aye, sister, so did I, and warned the girls.

378
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,965
- Too smooth and plausible by half.
- But would anybody listen to me?

379
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:41,218
And now we are all, all ruined!

380
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:46,098
Oh, my poor girl. My poor, poor Lydia.

381
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,986
When shall we travel
into Hertfordshire, my love?

382
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:03,740
Come away from the window, dear.
When I have settled my business affairs.

383
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,661
These things always take longer
than one thinks they will.

384
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,540
- You're not unhappy, surely?
- Lord, no!

385
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:18,046
Just that I can't wait to see my mother's face!
And my sisters'. Kitty will be so envious!

386
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,424
How I shall laugh!

387
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:26,471
I hope we shall be married from Longbourn.
Then all my sisters will have to be my bridesmaids.

388
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,021
Oh, I do wish we could go out into the town,
and be seen at plays and assemblies.

389
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:37,482
All in good time. Be patient, dear.

390
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:43,238
Lord, it makes me want to burst out laughing

391
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:46,783
when I think that I have done
what none of my sisters has.

392
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,995
And I the youngest of them all!

393
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:59,171
Mother! Here is a letter from my Uncle Gardiner!

394
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,551
- Father is coming home today!
- Does he bring Lydia?

395
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:05,719
No.

396
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,638
He and my uncle have not yet discovered
where she is.

397
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:13,393
- My uncle will continue his enquiries alone.
- Coming home without poor Lydia?

398
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:18,273
Who will fight Wickham and make him marry her,
if he comes away?

399
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,276
Oh, Jane, Jane, what is to become of us?

400
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:27,574
Oh, oh, fetch my smelling salts!
I feel my faintness coming upon me again!

401
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:41,588
Not now, Jane. Not now, Lizzy.

402
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,359
Mrs. Younge.

403
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:54,327
Should I go and get Father?
He has had nothing to eat since he came home.

404
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,623
Let me. You take Mother her tea.

405
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,144
Well, Jane.

406
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,688
Elizabeth.

407
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,982
Mary, Kitty.

408
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,445
You look so tired, Father.

409
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:32,532
- It must have been a dreadful time for you.
- Say nothing of that.

410
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:39,998
Who should suffer but myself?
It has been my own doing and I ought to feel it.

411
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:41,833
Oh, Papa.

412
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,629
You must not be so severe upon yourself.

413
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:49,925
No, Lizzy, let me for once in my life
feel how much I have been to blame.

414
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:56,139
I am not afraid of being overpowered
by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.

415
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:04,981
- Do you still suppose them to be in London, sir?
- Yes, where else can they be so well concealed?

416
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:08,193
And Lydia always wanted to go to London.

417
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:15,367
She is happy, then. And her residence there
will probably be of some duration.

418
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,412
Lizzy.

419
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:24,459
I bear you no ill will for being justified
in your advice to me in May,

420
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:30,340
which, considering the event,
shows some greatness of mind, I think.

421
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,136
I must take Mamma her tea.

422
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,474
She still keeps her state above stairs, does she?

423
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:44,854
Good. it lends such an elegance to our misfortune!
Another time I'll do the same.

424
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:51,570
I'll sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering
gown, and I'll give as much trouble as I can.

425
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,950
Or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.

426
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:02,122
I'm not going to run away. If I should go
to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.

427
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:08,044
You go to Brighton? I wouldn't trust you
as near it as Eastbourne. Not for fifty pounds!

428
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:13,842
No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious,
and you will feel the effects of it.

429
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:19,848
No officer is ever to enter my house again.
Or even to pass through the village!

430
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:26,271
Balls will be absolutely prohibited,
unless you stand up with one of your sisters!

431
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,357
And you are never to stir out of doors

432
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:33,111
until you've spent ten minutes every day
in a rational manner.

433
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:40,327
Well, well, well,
don't make yourself unhappy, my dear.

434
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:45,040
If you are a good girl for the next ten years,
I'll take you to a revue at the end of them.

435
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,864
Oh, dearest, shall we not go out tonight?

436
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,493
Can we not go to the theatre?

437
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:27,374
- Lord! What in the world is he doing here?
- What?

438
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:31,252
- What a joke!
- Who is it?

439
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:33,421
- You'll never guess!
- Who is it?

440
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:37,008
Mr. Darcy.

441
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,665
Come in.

442
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,297
Thank you, Hill.

443
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:34,274
Hill, what is it? ls Mrs. Bennet asking for us?

444
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,067
No, ma'am.

445
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:41,740
I beg your pardon, but did you know an express
come for master from Mr. Gardiner?

446
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:45,744
- When did it come, Hill?
- Oh, about half an hour ago, ma'am.

447
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:15,273
- Well, Lizzy?
- Papa, what news?

448
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:20,487
- What news from my uncle?
- Yes, I've had a letter from him.

449
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:26,284
- What news does it bring? Good or bad?
- What is there of good to be expected?

450
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,245
Perhaps you would like to read it yourself.

451
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:35,627
Read it aloud, Lizzy.
I hardly know what to make of it myself.

452
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:41,257
"My dear brother, at last I am able to send tidings
of my niece and Mr. Wickham.

453
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,719
- "I have seen them..."
- It's as I hoped! They are married!

454
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:50,016
"They are not married, nor can I find
there was any intention of being so,

455
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:56,064
"but if you will perform the engagements I have
ventured to make for you, they will before long."

456
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:58,483
- What engagements?
- Read on.

457
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:05,406
"All that is required is to assure your daughter her
equal share of the 5,000 pounds she will inherit,

458
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:09,786
"and also allow her, during your life,
100 pounds per annum."

459
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,249
So little? What about Wickham's debts?

460
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,836
Read on.

461
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:22,465
"Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so
hopeless as they are generally believed to be."

462
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,759
- There!
- Read on, Lizzy.

463
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:31,307
"There will be some little money, even when all
his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece."

464
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:36,187
- I cannot believe it.
- Read on.

465
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:42,735
"We've judged it best that my niece should be
married from this house. I hope you approve."

466
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:45,738
Kitty will be disappointed
not to be a bridesmaid.

467
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:52,120
"Send back your answer as soon as you can
with the explicit financial settlement. Yours," etc...

468
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,585
How can it be possible
he will marry her for so little?

469
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:03,715
He must not be undeserving, as we thought.
He must truly be in love with her, I think.

470
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,051
You think that, Jane, if it gives you comfort.

471
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:11,764
- Have you answered the letter?
- No, but I must and soon.

472
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:20,648
And they must marry. Yet he is such a man.

473
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:24,027
Yes, they must marry.
There's nothing else to be done.

474
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,404
There are two things I want to know.

475
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,909
One is, how much money your uncle laid down
to bring this about,

476
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:35,204
and the other, how am I ever to repay him?

477
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:44,464
I wish I had never spoken of this to Mr. Darcy.

478
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:50,803
Dear Lizzy, please do not distress yourself.
I'm sure Mr. Darcy will respect your confidence.

479
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:55,391
I'm sure he will. That is not what distresses me.

480
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:58,853
- What, then?
- I don't know!

481
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:03,358
How he must be congratulating himself
on his escape!

482
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:09,489
- How he must despise me now.
- But Lizzy, you never sought his love.

483
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,200
Nor welcomed it when he offered it.

484
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:16,079
If he has withdrawn his high opinion of you,
why should you care?

485
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,665
I don't know!

486
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,417
I can't explain it.

487
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,798
I know I shall probably never see him again.

488
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,804
I cannot bear to think
that he is alive in the world...

489
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:36,140
and thinking ill of me.
