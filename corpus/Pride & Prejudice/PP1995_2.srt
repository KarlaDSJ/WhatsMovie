1
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,071
I hope, my dear,
you have ordered a good dinner today,

2
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:15,987
because I have reason to expect an addition
to our family party.

3
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,578
Mr. Bingley!

4
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,634
Why, Jane, you sly thing,
you never dropped a word.

5
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,090
And not a bit of fish to be got. Oh, Lord.

6
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,761
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.
I must speak to Hill directly.

7
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:35,722
It is not Mr. Bingley. It is a person I never saw
in the whole course of my life.

8
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,811
- Colonel Forster!
- Captain Carter!

9
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,943
No, I know. Denny!

10
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,651
About a month ago, I received this letter.

11
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:55,405
About a fortnight ago, I answered it, for it was
a case of some delicacy, requiring early attention.

12
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,493
It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins...

13
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,000
who, when I am dead, may turn you all
out of this house as soon as he pleases.

14
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,955
Oh, my dear, pray don't mention that odious man!

15
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:13,427
It is the hardest thing in the world, that your
estate should be entailed away from your children.

16
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:18,261
Indeed, my dear, nothing can clear Mr. Collins
of the iniquitous crime of inheriting Longbourn,

17
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:23,349
but if you'll listen to his letter, you may be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.

18
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:31,531
"My dear sir, the disagreement subsisting
between yourself and my late honored father

19
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:37,242
"always gave me much uneasiness, and since
I have had the misfortune to lose him...

20
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:44,711
"..to lose him, I have frequently wished
to heal the breach."

21
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:49,672
There, Mrs. Bennet. "My mind, however,
is now made up on the subject..."

22
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:55,005
...for, having received my ordination at Easter,
I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished

23
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:59,854
by the patronage of the Right Honorable
Lady Catherine de Bourgh...

24
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:07,484
whose bounty and beneficence has preferred
me to the valuable rectory at Hunsford,

25
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:13,775
where it is my endeavor to demean myself
with grateful respect towards her Ladyship.

26
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:19,367
As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty
to promote and establish

27
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:24,161
the blessing of peace in all families
within the reach of my influence,

28
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,088
and on these grounds I flatter myself that
my overtures of goodwill are highly commendable,

29
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:35,011
and will not lead you to reject
the offered olive branch.

30
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:40,512
I am, sir, keenly conscious of being the means
of injuring your amiable daughters,

31
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:45,228
and assure you of my readiness to
make them every possible amends.

32
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:50,731
I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family on Monday the 18th...

33
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,572
Have a care, Dawkins!

34
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:58,612
...and shall probably trespass on your hospitality
till the Saturday seven-night following.

35
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,829
I shall travel as far as the turnpike
in my own modest equipage,

36
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:06,832
where I hope to catch the Bromley Post
at 35 minutes past ten,

37
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:10,536
and thence to Watford, from whence
I shall engage a hired carriage

38
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,538
to transport me to Longbourn,

39
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,130
where, God willing, you may expect me
by four in the afternoon.

40
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,299
And here he comes.

41
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,393
He must be an oddity, don't you think?

42
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:28,354
If he's disposed to make our girls any amends,
I shan't be the person to discourage him.

43
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:33,106
- Can he be a sensible man, sir?
- Oh, I think not, my dear.

44
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:38,402
Indeed, I have great hopes of finding him
quite the reverse.

45
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,740
Mr. Collins.

46
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,368
You are very welcome.

47
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,965
My dear Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.

48
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,718
You seem very...

49
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:11,095
fortunate in your patroness, sir.

50
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,858
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

51
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:19,991
Indeed I am, sir. I have been treated
with such affability, such condescension,

52
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:23,242
as I would never have dared to hope for.

53
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:28,162
I have been invited twice to dine at Rosings Park.

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,620
That so? Amazing.

55
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,672
Does she live near you, sir?

56
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:42,506
The garden, in which stands my humble abode,
is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park.

57
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:46,314
Only a lane, eh? Fancy that, Lizzy.

58
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:54,476
I think you said she was a widow, sir?
Has she any family?

59
00:05:54,605 --> 00:06:01,315
She has one daughter, ma'am. The heiress
of Rosings, and of very extensive property.

60
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,275
And has she been presented at court?

61
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:11,463
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution
which unhappily prevents her being in town.

62
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,710
And by that means,
as I told Lady Catherine myself one day,

63
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:21,755
she has deprived the British court
of its brightest ornament.

64
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:28,013
You may imagine, sir, how happy I am on every
occasion to offer those little delicate compliments,

65
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,848
which are always acceptable to ladies.

66
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,062
Then it is fortunate for you, Mr. Collins,

67
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:39,316
that you possess such an extraordinary talent
for flattering with delicacy.

68
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:45,863
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions
proceed from the impulse of the moment,

69
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,659
or are they the result of previous study?

70
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,583
They arise chiefly
from what is passing at the time, sir.

71
00:06:55,833 --> 00:07:00,343
I do sometimes amuse myself by writing down
and arranging such little compliments

72
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,472
as may be adapted to ordinary occasions.

73
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,553
But I try to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

74
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:08,798
Excellent.

75
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,524
Excellent.

76
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:32,905
I must confess myself quite overwhelmed
with the charms of your daughters, Mrs. Bennet.

77
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:37,206
Oh, you are very kind, sir.
They are sweet girls, though I say it myself.

78
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,553
Perhaps especially the eldest Miss Bennet?

79
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,090
Ah, yes, Jane is admired wherever she goes.

80
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:50,925
But I think I should tell you, Mr. Collins, I think it
very likely she will be very soon engaged.

81
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:56,234
- Ah.
- As for my younger daughters, if any of them...

82
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,771
In their case I know of no prior attachment at all.

83
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,397
Ah.

84
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,457
We're all going to Meryton
to see if Denny is returned from town!

85
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:21,341
Perhaps you would care for a little exercise,
Mr. Collins?

86
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,922
Indeed I would, Mrs. Bennet.

87
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,719
Cousin Elizabeth!

88
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:34,387
Would you do me the great honor
of walking with me into town?

89
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:48,066
You visit your Aunt Philips in Meryton frequently,
I understand'?

90
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:52,235
Yes, she is very fond of company,
but you'll find her gatherings poor affairs

91
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,866
after the splendors of Rosings Park.

92
00:08:54,993 --> 00:09:01,003
No, I think not. I believe I possess the happy
knack, much to be desired in a clergyman,

93
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:05,804
of adapting myself to every kind of society,
whether high or low.

94
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:11,261
- That is fortunate indeed.
- Yes, indeed, and though it is a gift of nature,

95
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:17,465
constant study has enabled me, I flatter myself,
to make a kind of art of it.

96
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:45,253
There! I'm sure that's new in since Friday.
Isn't it nice? Don't you think I'd look well in it?

97
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,207
- Not as well as me. Come on!
- No, I shan't.

98
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,168
Jane. Come here. Look at this.

99
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,434
Jane, I'm determined to have this bonnet.

100
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,314
Look, there's Denny!

101
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,313
- Where'?
- There. Look.

102
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,521
- Who's that with him?
- Don't know.

103
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,725
- He's fearful handsome.
- He might be if he were in regimentals.

104
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,687
- A man looks nothing without regimentals.
- They're looking over.

105
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,108
Lizzy, is he not mightily good-looking?

106
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,989
- Denny!
- Lydia!

107
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,672
What a fine joke,
we thought you were still in town.

108
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,000
There was nothing amusing enough
to hold us there.

109
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,126
Allow me to introduce my good friend
George Wickham.

110
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,594
Miss Bennet, Miss Elizabeth Bennet,
Miss Mary Bennet,

111
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:36,596
Miss Catherine Bennet and Miss Lydia Bennet.

112
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,390
This is our cousin, Mr. Collins.

113
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,392
Do you stay long in Meryton, Mr. Wickham?

114
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:47,937
All winter, I'm happy to say. I've taken
a commission in Colonel Forster's regiment.

115
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,145
There, Lydia. He will be dressed in regimentals.

116
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,446
And lend them much distinction, I dare say.
Out-swagger us all, eh, Wickham?

117
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,162
Denny, you misrepresent me
to these young ladies.

118
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:02,753
- Shall you come with us to Aunt Philips's tonight?
- Oh, yes. Denny is coming, you know.

119
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,371
It's only supper and cards,
but we shall have some laughs.

120
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:10,459
- I've not been invited by Mr. and Mrs. Philips.
- No one cares about that sort of thing nowadays.

121
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:15,507
If Mrs. Philips extended the invitation
to include me, I should be delighted.

122
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,221
Look, Jane. It's Mr. Bingley.

123
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,269
How very fortunate! We were just on our way
to Longbourn to ask after your health.

124
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:34,491
You're very kind, sir.
I'm quite recovered, as you see.

125
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,451
Yes. I'm very glad to know it.

126
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,658
I hope you will have tea with us at Longbourn.

127
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,785
I shall be very happy to, Miss Bennet.

128
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,678
- Look, there's Denny!
- And Chamberlayne.

129
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,308
...such a variety of social intercourse.

130
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:10,976
What a charming apartment you have here,
Mrs. Philips.

131
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:16,146
Upon my word, it reminds <i>me</i> greatly
of the small summer breakfast room at Rosings.

132
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,703
Does it indeed, sir?
I'm much obliged to you, I'm sure.

133
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:24,454
I'm sure that Mr. Collins
wishes to pay a compliment, Aunt.

134
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,248
Does he? I see.

135
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:32,459
Rosings Park, we must understand,
is very grand indeed.

136
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,546
Indeed it is.

137
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,091
My dear madam,
if you thought that I intended any slight

138
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:42,506
on your excellent and very comfortable
arrangements, I am mortified.

139
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,850
Rosings Park is the residence of my noble
patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

140
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,347
Oh, now I understand.

141
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,280
The chimney piece in the second
drawing room alone cost 800 pounds.

142
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,951
Now I see,
it's clear there's no of fence at all.

143
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,237
Will you oblige me and sit down
to a game of whist?

144
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:11,329
I must confess I know little of the game, madam,
but I shall be glad to improve myself.

145
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,880
If my fair cousin will consent to release me?

146
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,378
With all my heart, sir.

147
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,148
Oh, Mr. Collins!

148
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,449
- What were trumps again?
- Hearts, Mr. Collins. Hearts.

149
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,600
I must confess I thought I should never escape
your younger sisters.

150
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,389
They can be very determined. Lydia especially.

151
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:16,686
But they're pleasant girls. I find that society
in Hertfordshire quite exceeds my expectations.

152
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:22,152
I don't see Mr. Bingley and his friends
here this evening.

153
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,119
I think some of Mr. Bingley's friends
would consider it beneath their dignity.

154
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,620
Really?

155
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,423
Have you known Mr. Darcy long?

156
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,543
- About a month.
- I've known him all my life.

157
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,971
- We played together as children.
- But...

158
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,590
Yes, you're surprised.

159
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,888
Perhaps you might have noticed
the cold manner of our greeting?

160
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,974
I confess I did.

161
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,637
Do you...

162
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:58,357
Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?

163
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,151
As much as I ever wish to be.

164
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,828
I've spent three days in the same house with him,
and I find him very disagreeable.

165
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:14,498
I fear there are few who would share
that opinion...except myself.

166
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:21,552
But he's not at all liked in Hertfordshire.
Everybody is disgusted with his pride.

167
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,378
Do you know...

168
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,933
- Does he intend to stay long at Netherfield?
- I do not know.

169
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:33,224
I hope his being in the neighborhood
will not affect your plans to stay.

170
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,600
Thank you.

171
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:39,234
But it is not for me
to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.

172
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,686
If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go.

173
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:46,525
We're not on friendly terms,
but I have no reason to avoid him but one:

174
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,615
he's done me great wrong.

175
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,406
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy,
was my godfather,

176
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,827
and one of the best men that ever breathed.

177
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,503
My father was his steward,

178
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:06,717
and when he died, old Mr. Darcy cared for me,
provided for me, loved me, I believe,

179
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,261
as though I were his own son.

180
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:12,055
He intended me for the church.

181
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,056
And it was my dearest wish
to enter into that profession.

182
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:23,114
But after he died,
and the living he'd promised me fell vacant...

183
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:28,317
the son refused point-blank
to honor his father's promises.

184
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:33,242
And so, you see,
I have to make my own way in the world.

185
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:38,118
This is quite shocking!
I had not thought Mr. Darcy as bad as this.

186
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:42,418
To descend to such malicious revenge,
he deserves to be publicly disgraced.

187
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,549
Someday he will be, but not by me.

188
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,932
Till I can forget his father,
I can never defy or expose him.

189
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:59,135
I wonder at the pride of this man.
How abominable!

190
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,809
You are more temperate than I should be
in your situation.

191
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:08,033
Well, I have not the resentful temper
that some men have.

192
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:13,663
And my situation, you know, is not so bad.
At present I have every cause for cheer.

193
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,663
I can't bear to be idle,

194
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,826
and my new profession gives me
active employment.

195
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,326
My fellow officers are excellent men.

196
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:27,384
And now I find myself in a society
as agreeable as any I've ever known.

197
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,835
I absolutely forbid you to feel sorry for me.

198
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,597
Lizzy? Lizzy, why should you feel sorry
for Mr. Wickham?

199
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,472
Why? Because...

200
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,638
Because I've not had a dance
these three months together.

201
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,520
Poor Mr. Wickham! Well, you shall have one now.

202
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,068
Mary, Mary! The Barley Mow.

203
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,909
Oh, Mr. Collins!

204
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,007
I cannot believe it, Lizzy.

205
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,590
Mr. Darcy would have far too high a respect
for his father's wishes

206
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,177
to behave in such an unchristian way.

207
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:20,813
Lizzy, consider, how could his most intimate
friends be so deceived in him?

208
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,942
I could more easily imagine Mr. Bingley
being imposed upon,

209
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,773
than to think that Mr. Wickham
could invent such a history.

210
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,070
I believe you like Mr. Wickham, Lizzy.

211
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,451
I confess I do like him.

212
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,869
I do not see how anyone could not like him.

213
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,126
There is something very open and artless
in his manner.

214
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,705
He feels deeply, I believe,

215
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,548
and yet has a natural merriment and energy,
despite all this.

216
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,006
Yes, Jane, I confess I like him very much.

217
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,481
But after so short an acquaintance,

218
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,351
do you think we should believe in him
so implicitly?

219
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,265
How could he be doubted?

220
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:13,903
He gave me all the circumstances, Jane.
Names, facts.

221
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,739
Everything without ceremony.

222
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:22,246
If it isn't so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.
Besides, there was truth in all his looks.

223
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,957
It is difficult, indeed.

224
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,714
It is distressing.

225
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,590
One does not know what to think.

226
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,180
I beg your pardon,
one knows exactly what to think.

227
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:43,433
Oh, girls! Girls, we have all been
invited to a ball at Netherfield!

228
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,438
- Oh, good. I love a ball.
- So do I.

229
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,150
This will be a compliment to you, Jane, you know.

230
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,614
The invitation includes you, Mr. Collins.

231
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,779
But shall you accept, sir? Would it be
entirely proper? Would your bishop approve?

232
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,950
Your scruples do you credit, my dear cousin.

233
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,959
But I am of the opinion that a ball of this kind,

234
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:12,302
given by a man of good character
to respectable people,

235
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,460
can have no evil tendency.

236
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,890
And I am so far from objecting to dancing myself,

237
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,470
that I shall hope to be honored with the hands of
all my cousins during the course of the evening.

238
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:31,437
And I take this opportunity of soliciting yours...

239
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,279
...Miss Elizabeth, for the first two dances.

240
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:53,041
I dare say you'll be able to imagine the scope
of the whole, Mr. Wickham,

241
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,549
when I tell you that the chimney piece alone,
in the second drawing room,

242
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,434
cost all of 800 pounds.

243
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:05,061
800 pounds, sir! I hazard a guess
it must be a very large one?

244
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,731
It is very large indeed, sir.

245
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,558
- Her Ladyship is fond of a good blaze, then?
- Oh...

246
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,855
Mr. Collins.

247
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:18,067
How fortunate. I must claim you
for my sister Mary.

248
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:22,074
She has found a passage in Fordyce's Sermons
that she cannot make out at all.

249
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:26,908
- Well, I...
- I believe it is of great doctrinal import, sir.

250
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,079
- In that case...
- You're very kind, sir.

251
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,417
She's in the drawing room.

252
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:42,643
Mr. Collins' conversation is very...

253
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,428
...wholesome.

254
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:48,975
And there is plenty to be had of it, I assure you.

255
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,232
- Have you made Mr. Bingley's acquaintance yet?
- No.

256
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,937
But I'm already disposed to approve of him.

257
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,028
He has issued a general invitation
to the officers for his ball,

258
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,525
which has caused great joy
in more than one quarter.

259
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,785
- He must be a very amiable gentleman.
- Oh, yes.

260
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,002
He is eager to approve of everyone he meets,

261
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,963
but he's a sensible man,
with taste and judgment.

262
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,210
I wonder very much
how Mr. Darcy could impose upon him.

263
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,629
He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.

264
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:26,678
Probably not. Mr. Darcy can please
what he chooses, if he thinks it worth his while.

265
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,270
Among his equals in wealth and consequence,
he can be liberal-minded,

266
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,402
honorable, even agreeable.

267
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:39,981
- I wonder you can speak of him so tolerantly.
- He is not wholly bad.

268
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:47,158
Tell me, what sort of girl is Miss Darcy?

269
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,912
Well, I wish I could call her amiable.

270
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,827
As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing,
and extremely fond of me.

271
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,337
And I devoted hours to her amusement,

272
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,260
but she is grown too much like her brother.
Very... Very proud.

273
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:07,182
I never see her now. Since her father's death,
her home has been in London.

274
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:11,853
She is but 16 years old. Your sister Lydia's age.

275
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,102
Lydia is 15.

276
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:31,293
I was amused by your cousin's reference
to Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

277
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:35,871
She's Mr. Darcy's aunt, and her daughter Anne,
who will inherit a large fortune,

278
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,168
is destined to be Mr. Darcy's bride.

279
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,748
Really?

280
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,011
Poor Miss Bingley.

281
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,654
Ah, you look very well, Lizzy!

282
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:04,321
You'll never be as pretty as your sister Jane,
but I will say you look very well indeed!

283
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,741
Thank you, Mama.

284
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:12,293
I hope you will pay Mr. Collins every courtesy
tonight because he's been very attentive to you.

285
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,620
Your gown is very unbecoming, too!

286
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:18,916
- Then I shall ask Lizzy, she will bear me out.
- Lydia, what are you doing?

287
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:23,091
- Go back in your room and dress yourself!
- I have to ask Lizzy something!

288
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,264
Lizzy. Lizzy, look. What do you think?

289
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,644
Kitty says not,
but I think it becomes me very well.

290
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:34,101
- I wonder that you ask me, then.
- You look very nice.

291
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,643
Thank you.

292
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:40,056
Don't keep Wickham to yourself all night.
Kitty and I want to dance with him as well.

293
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:43,148
I promise I shall not.
Even if I wished to, I could not.

294
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:46,444
I have to dance at least the first two
with Mr. Collins.

295
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,909
Lord, yes.
He's threatened to dance with us all.

296
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,948
Allow me, cousin Elizabeth.

297
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,371
Cousin Jane.

298
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:18,118
My dear Jane, how delightful to see you,
and so well recovered!

299
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:22,458
Louisa and I have been
quite desolate without you, haven't we?

300
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,752
- Mr. Hurst?
- What'?

301
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,127
- Oh, Mrs. Bennet!
- Delighted.

302
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:32,344
- Mr. Bennet.
- Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Bennet! Quite delighted.

303
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,046
- And all your daughters.
- There's Denny.

304
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,717
- And Chamberlayne.
- And my cousin Mr. Collins.

305
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:42,728
May I congratulate you on
your very elegant arrangements, ma'am'?

306
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:48,232
It puts me to mind greatly of...
Perhaps you may have visited Rosings Park'?

307
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,994
Miss Bennet.

308
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,140
Miss Bennet.
You look quite remarkably well this evening.

309
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,975
Thank you.

310
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:10,481
I'm instructed to convey to you my friend
Wickham's regrets that he cannot attend the ball.

311
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,283
He's been obliged to go to town
on a matter of urgent business,

312
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:18,952
though I don't imagine it would have been urgent
if he'd not wished to avoid a certain gentleman.

313
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,623
Denny. I hope you've come prepared to
dance with us tonight.

314
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:32,168
Forgive the intrusion. I would dance with
both of your sisters at once if I could, but...

315
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,304
Never mind that. Come on, Denny.

316
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,653
Charlotte.

317
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,236
I have so much to acquaint you with.

318
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:05,493
Charlotte, may I present our cousin, Mr. Collins?
My friend, Miss Lucas.

319
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,333
- How do you do, sir?
- Miss Lucas.

320
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,496
I'm indeed honored to meet
any friend of my fair cousin's.

321
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,338
So many agreeable young ladies.

322
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,667
I'm quite enraptured.

323
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:53,501
- Other way, Mr. Collins!
- Madam, a thousand apologies...

324
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:56,666
My dear cousin, I apologize.

325
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:28,354
- It's extraordinary. And are you sure it's true?
- Charlotte, how could it be otherwise?

326
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,680
Every circumstance confirms it. And Mr. Darcy
has boasted to me himself of his resentful...

327
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,149
- Lizzy!
- What?

328
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:45,316
If you're not otherwise engaged, would you do me
the honor of dancing the next with me?

329
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,736
Why I...had not...

330
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,485
I thank you. Yes.

331
00:31:54,663 --> 00:32:00,043
Why could I not think of an excuse? Hateful man!
I promised myself I'd never dance with him.

332
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:04,009
He pays you a great compliment
in singling you out, Lizzy.

333
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,631
Think what you are doing.

334
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,218
You'd be a simpleton indeed

335
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:12,223
if you let your fancy for Wickham lead you
to slight a man of ten times his consequence.

336
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,955
I believe we must have some conversation,
Mr. Darcy.

337
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,627
A very little will suffice.

338
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,086
You should say something about the dance,
perhaps.

339
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,755
I might remark on the number of couples.

340
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:44,608
- You talk by rule, then, when you're dancing?
- Yes, sometimes it is best.

341
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:48,072
Then we may enjoy the advantage of
saying as little as possible.

342
00:33:55,868 --> 00:34:00,208
Do you consult your own feelings in this case,
or seek to gratify mine?

343
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,964
Both, I imagine.

344
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,601
We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition,

345
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:20,482
unwilling to speak unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room.

346
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,766
This is no very striking resemblance of
your own character, I'm sure.

347
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:17,242
- Do you often walk into Meryton?
- Yes, quite often.

348
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:26,252
When you met us the other day,
we had just been forming a new acquaintance.

349
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,759
Mr. Wickham has the happy manners
that enable him to make friends.

350
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:40,635
Whether he is equally capable of keeping them
is less certain.

351
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:50,572
He has been unlucky as to lose your friendship
in a way he's likely to suffer from all his life.

352
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:57,742
Allow me to congratulate you, sir!
Such superior dancing is rarely to be seen.

353
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:01,785
I'm sure your fair partner is well worthy of you.

354
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,080
I hope to have this pleasure often repeated.

355
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:08,134
Especially when a certain
desirable event takes place.

356
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,290
Eh, Miss Lizzy?

357
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,336
- What congratulations will then flow in!
- Sir, I...

358
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,644
I understand. I'll not detain you one moment longer
from your bewitching partner.

359
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,600
A pleasure, sir. Capital! Capital!

360
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:30,062
I remember hearing you once say
that you hardly ever forgave.

361
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,769
That your resentment once created
was implacable.

362
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,645
You are careful, are you not,
in allowing your resentment to be created?

363
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,358
I am.

364
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:54,496
And never allow yourself to be blinded
by prejudice?

365
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,380
I hope not.

366
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:59,126
May I ask to what these questions tend?

367
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:04,011
Merely to the illustration of your character.
I'm trying to make it out.

368
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,309
- And what is your success?
- I do not get on at all.

369
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,306
I hear such different accounts of you
as to puzzle me exceedingly.

370
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,600
I wish, Miss Bennet, that you would not attempt
to sketch my character at the present moment.

371
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,140
I fear the performance would reflect no credit
on either of us.

372
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:51,306
If I don't take your likeness now,
I may never have another opportunity.

373
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,896
I would by no means suspend
any pleasure of yours.

374
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:25,008
Miss Eliza, I hear you're quite delighted
with George Wickham.

375
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:28,717
No doubt he forgot to tell you,
among his other communications,

376
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:33,979
that he's merely the son of old Wickham,
the late Mr. Darcy's steward.

377
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,608
But, Eliza, as a friend,

378
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:42,614
let me recommend you
not to give credit to all his assertions.

379
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:48,698
- Wickham treated Darcy in an infamous manner.
- Has he? How?

380
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:54,497
I don't remember the particulars, but I do know
that Mr. Darcy was not in the least to blame.

381
00:38:55,751 --> 00:39:00,421
I pity you, Eliza,
for the discovery of your favorite's guilt,

382
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:04,837
but really, considering his descent,
one could not expect much better.

383
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:09,312
His guilt and his descent
appear by your account to be the same.

384
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:13,101
You accuse him of being nothing worse
than the son of Mr. Darcy's steward,

385
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,096
he informed me of that himself.

386
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,226
I beg your pardon.

387
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:21,651
Excuse my interference. It was kindly meant.

388
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,827
- Insolent girl!
- Lizzy!

389
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:40,707
I see nothing in her paltry attack but her own
ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy!

390
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,007
Yes, but Lizzy...

391
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:48,675
Mr. Bingley did say that though
he does not know the whole history,

392
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:53,104
he fears that Mr. Wickham is by no means
a respectable young man.

393
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,885
- Does he know Mr. Wickham himself?
- No, not at all.

394
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:59,519
Well, then he has had his account from Mr. Darcy.

395
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:04,613
I'm not in doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity.
Of course he would believe his friend.

396
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:09,826
As to the other two gentlemen, I shall venture
to think of them both as I did before.

397
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,290
Shall we not have some music?
I have a great desire for a song.

398
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,833
Caroline, can we persuade you?

399
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,705
Miss Mary Bennet.

400
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,669
I see you've anticipated me.

401
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:50,032
Slumber, dear maid

402
00:40:55,704 --> 00:41:01,084
Green boughs will cover thee

403
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:06,919
Cometh breathe over thee

404
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:11,218
Where thou art laid

405
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:15,224
Slumber, dear maid...

406
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,728
Lizzy! Look.

407
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,852
But they haven't been introduced!

408
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,319
- Can we not prevent him?
- Too late.

409
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:32,027
Mr. Darcy. I have made a remarkable...
I must say, an amazing discovery.

410
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:37,077
I understand that you are the nephew
of Lady Catherine de Bourgh of Rosings Park.

411
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,955
Mr. Darcy, I am in the happy position of
being able to inform you

412
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,843
that her Ladyship was in the best of health...

413
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,094
eight days ago.

414
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:50,881
I'm glad to hear it.

415
00:41:55,013 --> 00:42:00,193
- And what is your name, sir?
- My name is William Collins, Mr. Darcy.

416
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:04,480
And I have a very great honor to...

417
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,533
Well. Well.

418
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:16,486
Green boughs will cover thee

419
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:21,958
Cometh breathe over thee

420
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,252
Rowley!

421
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:35,933
Where thou art laid

422
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:53,526
My mother bids me bind my hair

423
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:57,695
With bands of rosy hue...

424
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,790
That'll do extremely well, child.
You've delighted us long enough.

425
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:09,085
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.

426
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,758
If I were so fortunate as to be able to sing,

427
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:24,229
I should have great pleasure, I am sure,
in obliging the company with an air.

428
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:30,402
Indeed I should, for I consider music
as a very innocent diversion,

429
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:34,945
and perfectly compatible
with the profession of a clergyman.

430
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:59,175
Mr. Collins is such a sensible,
respectable young man.

431
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:05,024
He's taken quite a fancy to Lizzy,
and I don't think he could find a better wife.

432
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:09,313
He favored Jane at first,
but Bingley was there before him.

433
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:12,529
Now there will be a great marriage!

434
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:18,661
And, of course, that will throw the girls
into the path of other rich men!

435
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,491
Lydia!

436
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,331
Lydia!

437
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,747
Lydia!

438
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:35,916
Lord! Denny, fetch me a glass of wine.
I can scarce draw breath, I'm so fagged!

439
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:48,981
...and Chamberlayne and Denny again.
Lydia only danced with him twice.

440
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:52,944
- I thought Mary sang very ill.
- Oh, yes. Poor Mary.

441
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:57,276
- But she is determined to do it.
- More fool her, I say.

442
00:44:57,404 --> 00:45:01,324
- Mr. Collins trod on my frock and tore it.
- Lizzy, my dear!

443
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:05,369
Mr. Collins, I'm sure there can be no objection.

444
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,959
Kitty, don't leave me.

445
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:11,541
- Lizzy, dear!
- What's the matter? It's only Mr. Collins.

446
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:16,628
Come, Kitty. I want you upstairs.
Mr. Collins has something to say to Lizzy.

447
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:18,547
Dear Mama, don't go.

448
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:23,505
Mr. Collins must excuse me, he can have
nothing to say that anyone could not hear.

449
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:29,978
Lizzy. I insist that you stay where you are
and hear Mr. Collins!

450
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,726
Come, Kitty. Come along.

451
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:53,041
Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that your modesty adds to your other perfections.

452
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,955
But you can hardly doubt the object
of my discourse,

453
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:01,338
however your feminine delicacy
may lead you to dissemble.

454
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,850
For as almost as soon as I entered the house,

455
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:11,602
I singled you out as the companion
of my future life.

456
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:17,396
But before I am run away
by my feelings on this subject,

457
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:23,485
perhaps it would be advisable for me
to state my reasons for marrying.

458
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,698
Mr. Collins...

459
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,499
My reasons for marrying are...

460
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:40,215
First, I think it a right thing for every clergyman
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.

461
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:46,095
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness.

462
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:50,811
And thirdly, which perhaps
I should have mentioned first...

463
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:57,651
that it is the particular recommendation of
my noble patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

464
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:01,534
"Mr. Collins," she said, "you must marry."

465
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:05,743
"Choose properly," she said.
"Choose a gentlewoman for my sake,

466
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:12,325
"and for your own, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up too high.

467
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:19,554
"Find such a woman as soon as you can,
bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her."

468
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:24,128
And your wit and vivacity,

469
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:27,139
I think, must be acceptable to her,

470
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:32,522
when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.

471
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,403
Yes.

472
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:42,403
So much for my general intention in favor
of matrimony. Now, as to my particular choice...

473
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,487
My dear cousin...

474
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,370
being, as I am, to inherit all this estate
after the death of your father,

475
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:56,123
I could not satisfy myself without resolving
to choose a wife from among his daughters.

476
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,801
And now nothing remains...

477
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:11,386
but to assure you, in the most animated language,
of the violence of my affections.

478
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:16,194
- Mr. Collins, please...
- To fortune I am perfectly indifferent.

479
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:22,531
I am well aware that 1,000 pounds in the
four per cents is all that you may be entitled to,

480
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,820
but rest assured, I shall never reproach
on that score when we are married.

481
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,367
You are too hasty, sir.

482
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:36,116
You forget that I've made no answer.
Let me do so now.

483
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:39,207
I thank you for your compliments.

484
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:43,504
I am very sensible of the honor
of your proposals, but...

485
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:47,337
it is impossible for me to accept them.

486
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:58,391
I am by no means discouraged. Indeed not.

487
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,439
I understand that it is usual for young ladies

488
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:05,074
to reject the addresses of the man
they secretly mean to accept,

489
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:11,243
when he first applies for their favor,
and therefore I shall hope, my dear cousin,

490
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:14,446
to lead you to the altar before long.

491
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:19,707
Upon my word, your hope is an extraordinary one
in view of my declaration.

492
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:23,882
I was perfectly serious in my refusal.

493
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:28,803
You could not make me happy, and I am the last
woman in the world who could make you so.

494
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:31,337
My dear Miss Elizabeth,

495
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:36,389
my situation in life, my connection
with the noble family of de Bourgh,

496
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:40,396
are circumstances highly in my favor.

497
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:47,027
Consider that it is by no means certain that
another offer of marriage may be made to you.

498
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:51,359
You cannot be serious in your rejection.

499
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:56,583
I must attribute it to your wish of increasing
my love by suspense,

500
00:49:56,703 --> 00:50:00,423
in the usual manner of elegant females.

501
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:02,923
I assure you, sir,

502
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:09,342
that I have no pretensions to the kind of elegance
which consists in tormenting a respectable man.

503
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:14,934
I thank you for the honor of your proposals,
but to accept them is absolutely impossible.

504
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,060
My feelings forbid it in every respect.

505
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,940
- Can I speak plainer?
- You are uniformly charming.

506
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:31,606
And I am persuaded that when sanctioned
by your excellent parents...

507
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:40,038
my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.

508
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:49,295
Oh, Mr. Bennet! You are wanted immediately.

509
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,917
We are all in uproar!

510
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:57,005
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins.
She vows she will not have him,

511
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:01,978
and if you do not make haste, Mr. Collins
will change his mind and he will not have her!

512
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:06,481
I have not the pleasure of understanding you.
Of what are you talking?

513
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:10,645
Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy!

514
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:16,952
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and
Mr. Collins begins to say he will not have Lizzy!

515
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:22,247
What am I to do on the occasion?
It seems a hopeless business.

516
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:28,041
Speak to Lizzy about it yourself!
Tell her you insist upon her marrying him!

517
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,013
Let her come in.

518
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:37,854
Lizzy! Lizzy!

519
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,100
Your father wishes to speak to you.

520
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,064
Come here, my child.

521
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:53,823
L...

522
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:58,907
I understand Mr. Collins has made you
an offer of marriage.

523
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:02,366
- Is this true?
- Yes, sir.

524
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:07,632
Very well. And this offer of marriage
you have refused?

525
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,417
- I have.
- I see.

526
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:17,259
Right, we now come to the point.
Your mother insists on your accepting it.

527
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:23,644
- Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?
- Yes, or I will never see her again!

528
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:27,853
An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.

529
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:31,859
From this day you must be a stranger
to one of your parents.

530
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:36,993
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr. Collins.

531
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,158
And...

532
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:42,582
I will never see you again if you do.

533
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,079
Oh, Mr. Bennet!

534
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:02,465
Sit down, Miss Lizzy!
I insist upon you marrying Mr. Collins!

535
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:07,437
- Why, Charlotte, what do you do here?
- I am come to see Elizabeth.

536
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:13,855
Mr. Collins has made Lizzy an offer,
and what do you think? She won't have him.

537
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:18,744
Then I am very sorry for him,
though I couldn't say I'm surprised.

538
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:22,123
If you don't, Miss Lizzy,
I will never speak to you again!

539
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:27,747
- I do not wish to discuss the matter any longer.
- Mr. Collins!

540
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:31,923
Mama's beside herself.
He says he won't stay another night.

541
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:39,428
- I wonder, should I invite him to dine with us?
- Aye, do! Do! Take him away and feed him.

542
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,850
For he's been in high dudgeon all morning!

543
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:56,441
- Oh, Mr. Collins!
- I am resigned.

544
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,315
Resignation is never so perfect,

545
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:05,656
as when the blessing denied begins to lose
somewhat of its value in our estimation.

546
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,498
Until tomorrow then, madam.

547
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,337
I take my leave.

548
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,927
Oh, Mr. Collins!
