Well, I should be delighted,

to release me from my reading.

625
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,209
what is amiss between you and Mr. Darcy?

626
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,505
Are you much acquainted with him?

627
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:24,673
More than I wish to be.

628
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,425
He's been here for less than a month

629
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:28,344
and is already the least popular man
in the county.

630
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:32,306
Yes, it always gives me great pain to see him.

631
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,683
I have been connected with his family
from infancy.

632
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,852
My father managed
the late Mr. Darcy's estate.

633
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:38,979
Darcy and I grew up together.

634
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,941
His father treated me like a second son.

635
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,068
I cannot begin to do justice to his kindness.

636
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,904
He bequeathed me with
the best living in his gift.

637
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,989
I had my heart set on joining the church.

638
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,034
But when he was slain
in the Second Battle of Kent,

639
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:54,370
Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave my living to another man.

640
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:58,082
What could have induced him
to behave so cruelly?

641
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,501
Pride.

642
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:04,213
He thought me too low
to be worth his consideration.

643
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:06,924

so, I can never expose Darcy

St. Lazarus is the key to finally ending the
struggle between the living and the undead.

872

with the most advanced among them.

will support such a venture.

my chance of happiness with him

888
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,669

896

have maintained their human ways.

The common hordes
look to them for leadership.

967
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:22,495
It takes just one of them
to realize their power

968
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:23,830
and then to lead the hordes into battle...

- Locusts.

973
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:40,680

Never.

Well, then the human race is surely doomed.

the undead will always multiply faster

983
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:07,332
than the living can procreate.

01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:10,418
Nine months to make a baby,
then 16 years to make a soldier,

985
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,545
and one raw second to make a zombie.

986
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:16,132
You must realize, if they were to organize,
we cannot defeat them.

987
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:18,885
The only hope is to find a way
to coexist with them,

988
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:21,846

989

LYDIA: No!

1386
01:32:33,299 --> 01:32:36,260
The undead will have reached the bridge
soon, and then it will be too late.

1387

They're not back yet! You must wait, Bingley!

1388
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:41,724
Detonate the bridge.

Give the order. Give the order.

1390
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:45,978
Yes, sir.

Lady Catherine, might I take this opportunity
to compliment you on your pantaloons?

1408
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:25,573
And your eye patch. It's very fetching.
Is it function or fashion?

1409
01:36:25,656 --> 01:36:27,867
Function.

1410

Lady Catherine.

1414
01:36:47,595 --> 01:36:50,306
This is all rather embarrassing,

1415
01:36:50,389 --> 01:36:54,059
but I would like to request
the privilege of speaking with Miss Jane.

1416
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:56,103
Alone.

1417
01:37:08,782 --> 01:37:09,909
Mr. Darcy.

1418
01:37:12,703 --> 01:37:15,664
LADY CATHERINE: My favorite nephew,
who lay unconscious for so long,

1419
01:37:15,748 --> 01:37:19,293
that when we heard you'd risen, we'd feared
you'd joined the ranks of the undead.

1420
01:37:20,669 --> 01:37:22,213
Any word from the canal?

1421
01:37:22,296 --> 01:37:24,256
It's holding for the time being.

1422
01:37:26,091 --> 01:37:27,134
JANE: Yes!

1423
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:28,886
LYDIA: Jane said yes.

1424
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:30,012
Would you excuse me?

1425
01:37:30,095 --> 01:37:31,764
LYDIA: Quick! Quick, quick!

1426
01:37:33,474 --> 01:37:35,392
This is so exciting!

1427

You look as though you're fully mended.

1432
01:37:57,331 --> 01:37:59,458
I am. Thank you.

1433
01:38:00,167 --> 01:38:03,212
If it wasn't for you,
I'd have surely perished.

1434
01:38:03,295 --> 01:38:06,006
You have saved me in more ways than one.

1435
01:38:07,967 --> 01:38:10,678
What you said to me on Hingham Bridge...

1436
01:38:13,055 --> 01:38:14,515
You heard me?

1437
01:38:15,683 --> 01:38:16,850
I did.

1438
01:38:18,477 --> 01:38:20,062
It gave me hope.

1439
01:38:20,896 --> 01:38:22,147
Of what?

1440
01:38:22,898 --> 01:38:25,985
That your feelings towards me
may have changed.

1441
01:38:28,195 --> 01:38:32,491
However, one word from you now
will silence me on this subject forever.

1442
01:38:54,096 --> 01:38:57,099
You are the love of my life, Elizabeth Bennet.

1443
01:39:00,644 --> 01:39:07,234
So I ask you now,
half in anguish, half in hope,

1444
01:39:10,654 --> 01:39:17,077
will you do me the great, great honor
of taking me for your husband?

1445
