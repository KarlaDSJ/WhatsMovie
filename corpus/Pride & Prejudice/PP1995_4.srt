1
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,951
You are the last man
whom I could ever marry!

2
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,247
Do you think any consideration would
tempt me? Your arrogance, your conceit,

3
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,333
and your selfish disdain
for the feelings of others!

4
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:28,255
My opinion of you was decided when I heard
Mr. Wickham's story of your dealings with him.

5
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,758
Well at least in that I may defend myself.

6
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,471
Could you expect me to rejoice
in the inferiority of your connections?

7
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:42,144
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations
whose condition in life is so below my own?

8
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,314
You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy.

9
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:50,569
Your declaration merely spared me
the concern I might have felt in refusing you,

10
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,780
had you behaved in a more
gentleman-like manner.

11
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,824
Who's there, Fitzwilliam?

12
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,954
- Darcy! We'd quite despaired of you!
- Is that my nephew?

13
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,417
Where have you been?
Let him come in and explain himself!

14
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,629
No. You will forgive me.

15
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:13,342
- You'll forgive me.
- Darcy, you are unwell?

16
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:18,889
I'm very well, thank you, but I have a pressing
matter of business. You'll forgive me.

17
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,808
Make my apologies to Lady Catherine, Fitzwilliam.

18
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,462
To Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

19
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,262
Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter,

20
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,808
that it contain any repetition
of those sentiments or offers

21
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,728
which were this evening so disgusting to you.

22
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,824
But I must be allowed to defend myself
against the charges laid at my door.

23
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,284
In particular those relating to Mr. Wickham,

24
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,914
which if true, would indeed be grievous,
but are wholly without foundation,

25
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,294
and which I can only refute by laying before you
his connection with my family.

26
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:40,512
Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable
man, who had the management of our estates.

27
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:45,142
My own father was fond of him
and held him in high esteem.

28
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,773
We played together as boys.

29
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:00,866
After his father's early death, my father
supported him at school and at Cambridge,

30
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,952
and hoped he would make the church
his profession.

31
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,127
But by then George Wickham's habits were
as dissolute as his manners were engaging.

32
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,722
My own excellent father died five years ago.

33
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,809
His attachment to Mr. Wickham
was to the last so steady,

34
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,938
that he desired that a valuable family living
might be his as soon as it was vacant.

35
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,567
Mr. Wickham declined
any interest in the church as a career,

36
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:41,239
but requested, and was granted,
the sum of 3,000 pounds instead of the living.

37
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:50,624
He expressed an intention of studying the law.
I wished, rather than believed him to be sincere.

38
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,920
Thank you.

39
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,009
I'm most exceedingly obliged.

40
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,348
All connection between us
seemed now dissolved.

41
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,519
Georgiana.

42
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,819
Being now free from all restraint,

43
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,364
his life was one of idleness and dissipation.

44
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,409
How he lived, I know not.

45
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:32,082
But last summer our paths crossed again,
under the most painful circumstances,

46
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,835
which I myself would wish to forget.

47
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:40,173
My sister, Georgiana,
who is more than ten years my junior,

48
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,219
was left to the guardianship
of Colonel Fitzwilliam and myself.

49
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,808
About a year ago,
she was taken from school to Ramsgate,

50
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:55,480
and placed in the care of a Mrs. Younge, in whose
character we were most unhappily deceived.

51
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,277
And thither also went Mr. Wickham,
undoubtedly by design.

52
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:07,284
She was persuaded to believe herself in love,
and to consent to an elopement.

53
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,704
She was then but fifteen years old.

54
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,753
A day or two before the intended elopement,
I joined them unexpectedly.

55
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:39,649
Unable to support the idea of grieving a brother
whom she looked up to almost as a father,

56
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,485
she acknowledged the whole plan to me
at once.

57
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,947
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.

58
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,951
Mr. Wickham left the place immediately.

59
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,458
Come.

60
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:07,761
Mr. Wickham relinquished his object, which was
of course, my sister's fortune of 30,000 pounds.

61
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:13,016
A secondary motive must have been
to revenge himself on me.

62
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,770
Had he succeeded, his revenge
would have been complete indeed.

63
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:23,193
This, madam, is a faithful narrative
of all my dealings with Mr. Wickham.

64
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,830
You do look pale, Lizzy.
Why don't you have some breakfast?

65
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,542
- I'm sure it will do you good.
- I am well, Charlotte.

66
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,546
I've stayed indoors too long.
Fresh air and exercise is all I need.

67
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,632
The woods around Rosings are so beautiful
at this time of year.

68
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,889
Miss Bennet!

69
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,809
Mr. Darcy.

70
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,354
I've been walking the grove some time
in the hope of meeting you.

71
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,941
Will you do me the honor of reading this letter'?

72
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,629
This, madam, is a faithful narrative
of my dealings with Mr. Wickham,

73
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,883
and for its truth I can appeal
to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam,

74
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,385
who knows every particular of these transactions.

75
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,264
I know not under what form of falsehood
Mr. Wickham imposed himself on you,

76
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,600
but I hope you'll acquit me
of cruelty towards him.

77
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,479
I found that I'd better not meet Mr. Darcy.

78
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,398
Scenes might arise,
unpleasant to more than myself.

79
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,821
The other charge leveled at me, is that
regardless of the sentiments of either party,

80
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,615
I detached Mr. Bingley from your sister.

81
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:21,538
I have no wish to deny this, nor can I blame
myself for any of my actions in this matter.

82
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:31,089
I had not long been in Hertfordshire
before I saw that Bingley admired your sister,

83
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:35,969
but it was not until the dance at Netherfield
that I suspected a serious attachment.

84
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:41,099
His partiality was clear, but though she received
his attentions with pleasure,

85
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,519
I did not detect any symptoms
of peculiar regard.

86
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:50,150
The serenity of her countenance convinced me
that her heart was not likely to be easily touched.

87
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,569
Insufferable presumption!

88
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:57,073
I did not wish to believe her to be indifferent.
I believed it on impartial conviction.

89
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,992
Very impartial!

90
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,579
You've missed the two gentlemen!
They came to take their leave!

91
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,746
Mr. Darcy came here?

92
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:08,585
He went away directly,
but the Colonel waited for you over half an hour!

93
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,503
Now they are gone abroad!

94
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,548
I dare say we shall be able to bear
the deprivation.

95
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:33,067
As to my objections to the marriage, the
situation of your family, though objectionable,

96
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:38,615
was nothing in comparison with the total want of
propriety so frequently betrayed by your mother,

97
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,785
your younger sisters,
and even occasionally your father.

98
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,753
That will do extremely well, child.
You have delighted us long enough.

99
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,298
Now there will be a great marriage!

100
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:01,137
And you know, that will throw the girls
into the paths of other rich men!

101
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,815
My friend left Netherfield for London
on the following day.

102
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:18,988
There I pointed out to him the certain evils of
his choice of your sister as a prospective bride.

103
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,659
It was not difficult to convince him
of your sister's indifference to him.

104
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,662
I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.

105
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,082
For destroying all her hope of happiness?

106
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,043
Yes, I'm sure you do not blame yourself.
Hateful man!

107
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:37,423
There is but one part of my conduct in the affair
on which I do not reflect with satisfaction.

108
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,800
Really? Astonish me.

109
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,303
That I concealed from him
your sister's being in town.

110
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,144
Perhaps this concealment was beneath me.

111
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,564
It was done, however, for the best.

112
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,652
On this subject I have nothing more to say,
and no other apology to offer.

113
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,821
Insufferable!

114
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,658
- Lizzy!
- Charlotte, we will be late!

115
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,493
Lizzy!

116
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:13,293
I have endeavored to count the times
Lady Catherine has invited us since your arrival.

117
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,296
I believe it may be as many as ten invitations!

118
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,215
- Eleven, counting this one!
- Eleven!

119
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:25,138
There! You have indeed been favored
with peculiar condescension.

120
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,766
- Do you not agree, Miss Elizabeth?
- Oh... yes!

121
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,602
How could anybody think otherwise?

122
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,690
And this is your last invitation,
on this visit, at least.

123
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,318
It is truly a very cruel deprivation.

124
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:42,363
I hardly know how I shall bear
the loss of Lady Catherine's company.

125
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,033
You feel it keenly!

126
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,162
Yes, of course you do, my poor young cousin.

127
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:56,502
They were such fine young men,
and so particularly attached to me!

128
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:01,424
They were excessively sorry to go,
but so they always are!

129
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,928
The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably,

130
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:10,224
but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely.

131
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,188
His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.

132
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:22,111
You are very dull this evening,
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

133
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,200
You have scarce spoke two words together.
Are you so out of spirits?

134
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:32,121
- No indeed, madam.
- Of course you are, to be going away yourself.

135
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:37,794
Who indeed would not be sad to be deprived
of Rosings, and indeed of the gracious...

136
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,631
You will write to your mother
and say you wish to stay longer.

137
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,967
She could certainly spare you
for another fortnight.

138
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,470
But my father cannot.

139
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,056
He wrote last week to hurry my return.

140
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:54,519
Your ladyship is very kind, but I believe
we must leave as planned on Friday.

141
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,855
Your father may spare you if your mother can.

142
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,109
Daughters are never of much consequence
to a father.

143
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,488
And if you will stay another month complete,

144
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:10,618
it will be in my power to take you
as far as London myself, in the Barouche box.

145
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:17,166
For I cannot bear the idea of two young women
traveling post by themselves.

146
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,794
It is highly improper!

147
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,965
I am excessively attentive to all those things.

148
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,385
My uncle is to send a servant for us
when we change to the post.

149
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:34,392
Your uncle! He keeps a manservant, does he?

150
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:39,689
I'm very glad you have somebody who thinks of
these things. Where will you change horses?

151
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,191
- At Brom...
- Bromley, of course.

152
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,195
Mention my name at the Bell
and they will attend you.

153
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,406
Your ladyship is very kind.

154
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:53,411
Indeed, we are all infinitely indebted
to your ladyship's kindly bestowed solicitude...

155
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,832
Yes, yes, but this is all extremely vexing!

156
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,127
I'm quite put out.

157
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,465
What are you doing? I thought the trunks
went outside before breakfast.

158
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,387
Lady Catherine was so severe about the only
right way to place gowns, that I couldn't sleep,

159
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,015
and I am determined to start afresh!

160
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,642
Maria, this is your trunk, these are your gowns.

161
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:21,898
You may arrange them in any way you wish.
Lady Catherine will never know!

162
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,818
My dear sister,
you will have much to tell your father...

163
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,653
Bring that one round here.

164
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,541
Well, cousin...

165
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,128
you have seen for yourself now
the happiness of our situation.

166
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,050
Our intimacy at Rosings is a blessing
of which few could boast.

167
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,470
- Indeed they could not.
- Indeed.

168
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,264
Now you have seen our felicity.

169
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,936
Perhaps you may think
your friend has made a very fortunate alliance.

170
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,771
Perhaps more so than...

171
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,985
- But on this point it will be as well to be silent.
- You are very good.

172
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,533
Only let me assure you that I can,
from my heart,

173
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:17,870
most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.

174
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,666
Charlotte and I have but one mind
and one way of thinking.

175
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,212
We seem to have been designed for each other!

176
00:17:48,025 --> 00:18:06,877
How much I shall have to conceal.

177
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,350
You must allow me to tell you
how ardently I admire and love you.

178
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,666
Lizzy!

179
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,960
Lizzy!

180
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,722
To see your faces when you looked up!

181
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,643
- You didn't expect we'd come to meet you.
- No, we did not.

182
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:09,690
There! ls not this nice? Cold ham and pork
and salads and every good thing!

183
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:14,320
We mean to treat you, but you must
lend us money, we spent ours. Look!

184
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,529
It's not pretty,

185
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,075
- but I thought I might as well buy it as not.
- It's vile, isn't it?

186
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,163
- Very ugly. What possessed you to buy it?
- There were two or three much uglier.

187
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,792
I shall pull it to pieces
and see if I can make it up any better.

188
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:34,507
It doesn't signify what anyone wears, for the
regiment will be at Brighton the whole summer!

189
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,092
Our hearts are broken!

190
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,595
We want papa to take us all to Brighton
for summer but he will not.

191
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,141
- I'm glad to hear it.
- Shouldn't you like to go to Brighton?

192
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,435
- I should not.
- She would.

193
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,981
She would love it, when she hears the news
about a certain person we all know.

194
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,527
- Shall we tell her?
- Yes, and watch to see if she blushes!

195
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,116
- You may go. We'll call if you're needed again.
- Very good, miss.

196
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,249
Wickham is not to marry Mary King after all!

197
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,877
She's been taken away by her uncle to Liverpool
and Wickham is safe!

198
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,715
Perhaps we should say Mary King is safe.

199
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,135
Was there a very strong attraction between them,
do you think'?

200
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,389
Not on his side! I shouldn't think
he cared three straws about her.

201
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:29,145
Who could about such a nasty freckled little thing?
Don't look at me like that, Lizzy!

202
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,565
I know you think as ill of her as I do.
Pass the celery, Kitty.

203
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,944
Aren't you glad we came to meet you?
It'll be merry on the journey home.

204
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,949
- Kitty, you're squashing my bandbox!
- You should have put it on the roof!

205
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:47,288
- If you didn't lollop about there'd be room for us all.
- I don't lollop, you do!

206
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,502
Mr. Darcy proposed! I can scarce believe it!

207
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,631
Not that anyone's admiring you
should be astonishing.

208
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:02,052
But he always seemed so severe,
so cold, apparently.

209
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:07,016
And yet he was in love with you all the time!
Poor Mr. Darcy.

210
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,685
I cannot feel so much compassion for him.

211
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,356
He has other feelings which will soon drive away
any regard he felt for me.

212
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:20,488
- You do not blame me for refusing him?
- Blame you? Oh, no.

213
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,826
But you do blame me for speaking
so warmly of Wickham?

214
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:31,707
No. How could you have known about his
vicious character? If indeed he was so very bad.

215
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:37,463
But I cannot believe Mr. Darcy would fabricate
such a dreadful slander,

216
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,132
involving his own sister too.

217
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,427
No, it must be true.

218
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:49,308
- Perhaps there has been some terrible mistake.
- No, Jane. That won't do!

219
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,727
You'll never be able to make them both good!

220
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:56,816
There is just enough merit between them
to make one good sort of man.

221
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,903
And for my part I'm inclined to believe
it's all Mr. Darcy's.

222
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,239
Poor Mr. Darcy.

223
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:08,369
Poor Mr. Wickham! There is such an expression
of goodness in his countenance.

224
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,666
Yes. I'm afraid one has all the goodness,
and the other all the appearance of it!

225
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:19,755
But, Lizzy,
I am sure when you first read that letter,

226
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,550
you could not have made so light of it
as you do now.

227
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,261
Indeed I could not.

228
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,641
I was very uncomfortable.
Till that moment I never knew myself.

229
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,687
And I had no Jane to comfort me.

230
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,982
Oh, how I wanted you.

231
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,239
There is one point on which I want your advice.

232
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:50,578
Should our general acquaintance be informed
of Wickham's true character?

233
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,917
Surely there can be no occasion
to expose him so cruelly.

234
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,254
- What is your own opinion?
- That it ought not to be attempted.

235
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:06,051
Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to make it public,
especially as regards his sister.

236
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,432
As for the rest, who would believe it?

237
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:16,020
The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy
is so violent, and Wickham will soon be gone.

238
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:20,983
- I believe we should say nothing at present.
- Yes, I agree.

239
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:27,698
Perhaps he is sorry now for what he has done,
and is anxious to re-establish his character.

240
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,159
We must not make him desperate.

241
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:36,081
Oh, Jane!
I wish I could think so well of people as you do.

242
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:42,254
Won't you speak to papa, Lizzy, about our going
to Brighton? You know he listens to your advice.

243
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:47,092
You flatter me, Lydia. In any case,
I shouldn't attempt to persuade him.

244
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:51,597
I think it's a very good thing that the regiment
should be removed from Meryton,

245
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,058
and that we should be removed from the regiment.

246
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:58,687
- Oh, Lizzy, how can you say such a thing?
- Very easily, ma'am.

247
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:05,361
If one company causes such havoc in our family,
what would a whole campful of soldiers do?

248
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,533
- A whole campful of soldiers!
- I remember when I was a girl.

249
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:15,496
I cried for two days when Colonel Miller's
regiment went away.

250
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:19,541
- I thought I should have broke my heart!
- Well, I'm sure I shall break mine.

251
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,335
And I!

252
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:27,424
There, there, my dears.
But your father is determined to be cruel.

253
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,551
I confess I am.

254
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:34,056
I'm sorry to be breaking hearts,
but I've not the smallest intention of yielding.

255
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,308
I shall not break my heart, papa.

256
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:41,105
The pleasures of Brighton would have no charms
for me. I should infinitely prefer a book.

257
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:46,777
- Mrs. Forster says she plans to go sea-bathing.
- I am sure I should love to go sea-bathing!

258
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:52,866
- A little sea-bathing would set me up forever!
- And yet, I am unmoved.

259
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,868
Well, well.

260
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:59,164
I'm glad you are come back, Lizzy.
I'm glad you are come back, Jane.

261
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,047
I want to go to Brighton!

262
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,657
You are not happy, Jane.

263
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:38,454
- It pains me to see it.
- It is just that I did...

264
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:42,833
I'm afraid I still do prefer Mr. Bingley
to any other man I've ever met,

265
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,545
and Lizzy, I did believe he...

266
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,133
Well, I was mistaken, that is all.

267
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,345
I am resolved to think of him no more.

268
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,098
There. Enough.

269
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,978
I shall be myself again,
as if I had never set eyes on him.

270
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:09,485
Truly, Lizzy, I promise. I shall be well.

271
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,531
I shall be myself again.
I shall be perfectly content.

272
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:30,255
Well, Lizzy, what do you think now
about this sad business of Jane's?

273
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,593
I cannot find out that she saw anything
of Bingley in London.

274
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,096
Well.

275
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:41,183
He is a very undeserving young man.

276
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:45,020
And I don't suppose there's the least chance
of her getting him now.

277
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:50,943
- If he should come back to Netherfield, though.
- I think there's little chance of that, mamma.

278
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,654
Oh, well. Just as he chooses.

279
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,323
No one wants him to come!

280
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:01,411
I shall always say he used my daughter
extremely ill!

281
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,914
If I was her, I would not have put up with it.

282
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:10,129
My comfort is, she will die of a broken heart,
and then he'll be sorry for what he's done!

283
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:15,384
So, the Collinses live quite comfortable, do they?

284
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,344
I only hope it will last.

285
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:22,766
And I suppose they talk about having
this house too when your father is dead?

286
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,311
They look on it as quite their own, I dare say?

287
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,398
They could hardly discuss such a subject
in front of me.

288
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:33,527
I make no doubt they talk about it constantly
when they're alone.

289
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:39,491
If they can be easy with an estate that is not
lawfully their own, so much the better.

290
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:43,954
I should be ashamed of having one
that was only entailed upon me.

291
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,749
Mamma, mamma! Lizzy!

292
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,129
Guess what! You never will, so I'll tell you.

293
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:56,967
Mrs. Forster has invited me, as her
particular friend, to go with her to Brighton.

294
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:01,513
- Colonel Forster is to take a house for us!
- Oh, Lydia! I am so happy!

295
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:05,809
- What an honor, to be singled out!
- Is it not unfair, Lizzy?

296
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,437
Mrs. Forster should have asked me as well.

297
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:13,275
I may not be her particular friend, but I have
just as much right to be asked as she has.

298
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,486
And more too, for I am two years older!

299
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,326
Well, I shall buy her a present, I dare say.

300
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:26,205
There's no call to be in a miff
because Mrs. Forster likes me above anyone.

301
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:32,461
Before you crow too loud, remember papa has not
given you permission to go. Nor is he like to.

302
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:39,426
Papa won't stop me. Not when I'm invited by
the Colonel to be his wife's particular companion!

303
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:44,806
I shall have to be bought new clothes. I've nothing
fit to wear and there will be balls and parties!

304
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:49,978
Of course you shall have new things! We wouldn't
see you disgraced in front of all the officers!

305
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,607
Ooh! All the officers!

306
00:28:56,777 --> 00:29:00,948
I understand your concern, my dear,
but consider:

307
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:06,745
Lydia will never be easy until she has
exposed herself in some public place,

308
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:12,542
and here is an opportunity for her to do so, with
very little expense or inconvenience to her family.

309
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:16,088
If you were aware, Father,
of the very great disadvantage to us all,

310
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:21,260
which must arise from Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner, which has already arisen,

311
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,638
- I'm sure you would judge differently.
- Already arisen?

312
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,015
Has she frightened away some of your lovers?

313
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,978
Don't be cast down, Lizzy.
Such squeamish youths are not worth your regret.

314
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,439
- Oh come, Lizzy.
- Indeed you are mistaken.

315
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:40,153
I have no injuries to resent.
I speak of general, not particular evils.

316
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,407
Our... position as a family,

317
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:47,494
our very respectability,
is called into question by Lydia's wild behavior.

318
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:57,587
I must speak plainly. If you do not check her,
she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.

319
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,841
Her character will be fixed
as the most determined flirt

320
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,510
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous!

321
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,348
You know that Kitty follows wherever Lydia leads.

322
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,394
Don't you see that they will be censured
and despised wherever they are known?

323
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,439
And that they will involve their sisters
in their disgrace.

324
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,858
Lizzy, come here.

325
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,114
Don't make yourself uneasy, my love.

326
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:29,703
Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued.

327
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,915
And you will not appear to any less advantage
for having a couple or...

328
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,918
I may say, three very silly sisters.

329
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:42,341
We shall have no peace at Longbourn
if Lydia does not go to Brighton.

330
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,636
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

331
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:52,934
And luckily she's too poor to be an object of prey
to a fortune hunter.

332
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:58,857
Leave it now, Lizzy.
I believe all will turn out well.

333
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,872
We are so desolated, Colonel,
that the regiment is to leave Meryton,

334
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:19,044
but words cannot express what we feel
about your kindness to our dear Lydia.

335
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:23,340
Well, ma'am, it appears that Mrs. Forster
cannot do without her.

336
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:28,804
Look at the pair of them. Thick as thieves!
Lord knows what they find to talk about.

337
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:33,809
But anything to keep the ladies happy.
What do you say, Wickham?

338
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,561
I say amen to that, sir.

339
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,240
There's one lady I shall be very loath
to part from.

340
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:53,412
We must bear it as best we can.
You are for Brighton, I'll be touring the Lakes

341
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:59,292
with my aunt and uncle. I dare say we'll find
ample sources of consolation and delight...

342
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:04,381
- in our different ways.
- Perhaps. How did you find Rosings?

343
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:09,719
Very interesting. Colonel Fitzwilliam was there with
Mr. Darcy. Are you acquainted with the Colonel?

344
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,805
L...

345
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:16,476
To some respects, yes, in former years.
A very gentlemanly man.

346
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,480
- How did you like him?
- I liked him very much indeed.

347
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:25,902
- His manners are very different from his cousin's.
- Yes.

348
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,824
But I think Mr. Darcy improves
on closer acquaintance.

349
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,326
Indeed?

350
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,204
In what respect?

351
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:42,544
Has he acquired a touch of civility in his address?
For I dare not hope he is improved in essentials.

352
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:48,842
No. In essentials, I believe he is very much...
as he ever was.

353
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,595
Ah.

354
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:59,227
I don't mean to imply that either his mind
or his manners are changed for the better.

355
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:04,816
Rather: my knowing him better
improved my opinion of him.

356
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,110
I see.

357
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,030
Wickham. Wickham.

358
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,743
- Come here.
- At your service, ma'am!

359
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,580
<i>Yes, 901 go'</i>

360
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,374
I would not wish you back again.

361
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,552
- Goodbye, papa. Goodbye, mamma.
- Lydia, my dear, we shall miss you most cruelly!

362
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:36,765
I shall write every day of what I'm doing
and make you wild with envy.

363
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,727
- I can't help it!
- I shall not envy her a jot!

364
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,730
I must go. Goodbye, Jane. Goodbye, Lizzy!

365
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:47,192
If I see any eligible beaux for you,
I'll send word express!

366
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,446
Lord, what a laugh if I should fall
and break my head!

367
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,323
I wish you would!

368
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:58,078
Oh, my dear girl.
Take every opportunity of enjoying yourself!

369
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,665
Bye! Bye!

370
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:24,271
Never mind, Kitty. I dare say, in a year or two
you'll have got over it tolerably well.

371
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:30,360
If anyone should ask for me,
I shall be in my library, and not to be disturbed.

372
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,969
Hello! I can see, I can see Alicia.
Look how she has grown!

373
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,808
You must be so tired.

374
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:08,690
You have all grown! I think you've all grown
since we last said goodbye!

375
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,693
And very prettily too!
Come into the house, then.

376
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,821
Such a sweet, steady girl!

377
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,323
Well, Lizzy!

378
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,746
We bear you bad tidings.
Not too grievous though, I hope.

379
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:27,334
The guilt is mine. My business won't allow me
time away to visit all the Lake country.

380
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,670
We shall have to content ourselves
with Derbyshire.

381
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,589
Oh.

382
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,759
But Derbyshire has many beauties, has it not?

383
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,512
Indeed. To me Derbyshire is the best
of all counties.

384
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,475
You will judge for yourself whether
Chatsworth is not the equal of Blenheim.

385
00:35:43,600 --> 00:36:08,917
And surely the southern counties
have nothing to compare to thewiid

386
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,168
Where?

387
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:16,049
At Lambton, a town of no consequence,
but to those fortunate enough to have lived in it.

388
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,511
I think it the dearest place in the world!

389
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,222
Then I shall not be happy till I have seen it.

390
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:28,103
It has one further claim on your interest:
it is but five miles from Pemberley,

391
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,272
and owes much of its prosperity
to that great estate.

392
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,941
So near?

393
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:39,114
Not that I or any of my acquaintance
enjoyed the privilege of intimacy with that family.

394
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,741
We moved in very different circles.

395
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,756
A hit! Acknowledged. Very good, sir!

396
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,719
- Enough, sir?
- Enough. Thank you, Baines.

397
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,848
- Will you come again tomorrow, sir?
- No, I have business in the North.

398
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:08,893
- I'll come back tomorrow week.
- Very good, sir. Bid you good day, sir.

399
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,895
Thank you, Baines. Good day.

400
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,778
I shall conquer this. I shall!

401
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,210
Elizabeth, be careful!

402
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,547
How could I face your father if you took a fall?

403
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,303
Beautiful!

404
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:54,481
- Thank you, Hannah.
- You're welcome, sir.

405
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:00,236
I should be quite happy to stay
my whole life in Derbyshire.

406
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:05,408
I'm happy to hear it. What do you say
to visiting Pemberley tomorrow?

407
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:11,539
- It's not more than a mile or two out of our way.
- Do you especially wish to see it, aunt?

408
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:15,126
I should have thought you would,
having heard so much about it.

409
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:20,715
The associations are not all unpleasant.
Wiokham passed all his youth there, you know.

410
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,759
We have no business there.

411
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:27,055
I should feel awkward to visit the place
without a proper invitation.

412
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,267
No more than Blenheim or Chatsworth.
There was no awkwardness there.

413
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:36,898
I shouldn't care for it myself, Lizzy,
if it were merely a fine house, richly furnished.

414
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:41,945
But the grounds are delightful. They have
some of the finest woods in the country.

415
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,282
- How far are we from Pemberley, my dear?
- Not more than five miles, sir.

416
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:51,412
- The grounds are very fine, are they not?
- As fine as you'll see anywhere, ma'am.

417
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,791
My oldest brother is an under-gardener there.

418
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,420
- Is the family here for the summer?
- No, ma'am.

419
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,383
Well?

420
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,721
Perhaps we might visit Pemberley after all.

421
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:46,676
I think we've seen woods and groves enough
to satisfy even your enthusiasm for them, Lizzy!

422
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,805
I confess I had no idea Pemberley
was such a great estate.

423
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,810
- Shall we reach the house itself before dark?
- Be patient. Wait.

424
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,065
There!

425
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,985
Stop the coach!

426
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:12,911
I think one would put up with a good deal
to be mistress of Pemberley.

427
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:17,540
The mistress of Pemberley will have to put up
with a good deal, from what I hear.

428
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,668
She's not likely to be anyone we know.

429
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:26,132
- How do you like the house, Lizzy?
- Very well.

430
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,304
I don't think I've ever seen a place
so happily situated.

431
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,642
I like it very well indeed.

432
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,727
Drive on!

433
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,732
A pity then, its owner should be
such a proud and disagreeable man.

434
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,568
Yes, a great pity.

435
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:53,284
Perhaps the beauty of the house
renders its owner a little less repulsive, Lizzy?

436
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,662
Yes, perhaps.

437
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,457
Perhaps a very little.

438
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:05,129
Well, shall we apply to the housekeeper
to see inside the place?

439
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:27,527
That's where Mrs. Darcy used to write her letters
every morning. It was her favorite room.

440
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,284
This is the music room.

441
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,040
- Charming!
- What a lovely room.

442
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,542
Delightful!

443
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:51,884
And there's a fine prospect from that window
down towards the lake.

444
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:57,015
- Look at this, my dear.
- It's quite magnificent!

445
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,439
Of all this I might have been mistress.

446
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:09,777
This piano has just come down. It's a present
from my master for Miss Georgiana.

447
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:15,324
- Your master is from home, we understand.
- Yes, but we expect him here tomorrow, sir.

448
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:20,455
He is coming with a large party of friends
and Miss Georgiana.

449
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:29,130
This portrait was painted earlier this year,
for her sixteenth birthday.

450
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,717
She is a very handsome young lady!

451
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:36,929
Oh, yes! The handsomest young lady
that ever was seen.

452
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:42,310
And so accomplished.
She plays and sings all day long!

453
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,853
Lizzy!

454
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,563
Look at this picture.

455
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,736
It reminds me very much
of someone we know!

456
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,654
This one, ma'am?

457
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:59,535
That young gentleman was the son
of the late Mr. Darcy's steward, Mr. Wickham.

458
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:05,792
He is gone into the army now. But he's turned out
very wild. Very wild indeed, I'm afraid.

459
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:10,588
And that's my master.
And very like him too.

460
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:15,384
It is a handsome face, but I've never seen
the original. Is it like him, Lizzy?

461
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:20,473
- Does this young lady know the master?
- Yes, a little.

462
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,519
And he is a handsome gentleman,
is he not, ma'am?

463
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,981
- Yes, very handsome.
- I'm sure I know none so handsome.

464
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,651
- Nor so kind.
- Indeed?

465
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:38,407
Aye, sir. I've never had a cross word from him,
and I've known him since he was four years old.

466
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:43,287
I've always observed that they
that are good-natured as children,

467
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,248
are good-natured when they grow up.

468
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:51,212
- His father was an excellent man.
- He was, ma'am. His son will be just like him.

469
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:56,926
The best landlord, and the best master.
Ask any of his tenants or his servants.

470
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,887
Some people call him proud.

471
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:05,226
I fancy that's only because he don't rattle away,
like other young men do.

472
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:11,065
Now if you will follow me, there's a finer,
larger portrait of him in the gallery upstairs.

473
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,484
This way, sir, if you please.

474
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:18,990
This fine account of Darcy is not quite consistent
with his behavior to poor Wickham.

475
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:22,910
- Perhaps we might have been deceived there.
- That's not likely, is it?

476
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:21,928
Ah!

477
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,640
Magnificent.

478
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,362
There!

479
00:46:56,856 --> 00:47:01,110
- Would you not like to ride him, sir?
- No, take him back to the stables.

480
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,978
Mr. Darcy.

481
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,733
Miss Bennet. I...

482
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:44,153
I did not expect to see you, sir.

483
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,156
We understood the family were from home,
or we should never have...

484
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:52,703
I returned a day early.
Excuse me, your parents are in good health?

485
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:57,083
Yes, they are very well. I thank you, sir.

486
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,543
I'm glad to hear it.

487
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,963
How long have you been in this part
of the country?

488
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,465
But two days, sir.

489
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,886
- Where are you staying?
- Lambton Inn.

490
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,763
Yes, of course.

491
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:16,685
Well, I'm just arrived myself.

492
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,023
And your parents are in good health?
And all your sisters?

493
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:25,319
Yes, they are all in excellent health, sir.

494
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,532
Excuse me.

495
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:42,044
- The man himself, I presume!
- As handsome as in his portrait.

496
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,799
- Though perhaps a little less formally attired.
- We must leave here at once!

497
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,053
- Of course, if you wish.
- Oh, I wish we'd never come!

498
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,891
- What must he think of me?
- What did he say?

499
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,145
Nothing of consequence.
He enquired after my parents...

500
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:23,586
Miss Bennet. Please allow me to apologize
for not receiving you properly. Were you leaving?

501
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,842
- We were, sir. I think we must.
- I hope you are not displeased with Pemberley'?

502
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,845
No, not at all.

503
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:39,143
- Then you approve of it?
- Very much. I think there are few who would not.

504
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:43,230
Your good opinion is rarely bestowed,
and therefore more worth the earning.

505
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,316
Thank you.

506
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:50,196
Would you do me the honor
of introducing me to your friends?

507
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,739
Certainly.

508
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:56,785
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Gardiner, Mr. Darcy.
Mrs. Gardiner is my aunt, Mr. Darcy.

509
00:49:56,911 --> 00:50:01,290
My sister Jane stayed at their house in Cheapside
when she was in London.

510
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:05,586
Delighted to make your acquaintance, madam, sir.
You're staying at Lambton, I hear.

511
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,380
Yes, sir. I grew up there as a girl.

512
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:14,345
Delightful village. I ran to Lambton as a boy
almost every day in the horse-chestnut season.

513
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,432
- There was one very fine tree there.
- On the green, by the smithy!

514
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,684
The very one.

515
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:25,272
- Mr. Gardiner, do you care for fishing?
- Indeed I do, sir, when I get the chance.

516
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,608
You must fish in my trout stream.

517
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:32,154
There are carp, tench and pike in the lake,
for coarse fishing.

518
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,908
I'll be happy to provide you with rods and tackle,
show you the best spots.

519
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,745
Let's walk down now.
Follow us to the lake. My man will show you.

520
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,415
There's a place down there
where we...

521
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,709
Is this the proud Darcy you told us of?

522
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:49,463
He is all ease and friendliness.
No false dignity at all!

523
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:54,301
I'm as astonished as you are. I can't imagine
what has affected this transformation.

524
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,136
Can you not?

525
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,492
- Do you...
-|...

526
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,160
Pray continue.

527
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:25,958
I was going to say again, sir,
how very unexpected your arrival was.

528
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:31,672
If we had known you were to be here, we should
not have dreamt of invading your privacy.

529
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,800
The housekeeper assured us
you would not be here until tomorrow.

530
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,429
Do not make yourself uneasy.
I had planned it so myself,

531
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:43,892
but I found I had business with my steward.
I rode on ahead of the rest of the party.

532
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,146
They will join me tomorrow.

533
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:52,318
And among them are those who claim
an acquaintance with you.

534
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,071
It's Mr. Bingley and his sisters.

535
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,618
Oh.

536
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:07,750
There is the other person in the party
who more particularly wishes to know you.

537
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,420
Will you allow me to...

538
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:17,051
Do I ask too much to introduce my sister to you,
during your stay at Lambton?

539
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:22,848
I should be very happy to make her acquaintance.

540
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,268
Thank you.

541
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,160
Thank you.

542
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,205
I hope we shall meet again very soon.

543
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:50,542
Good day, Mr. Gardiner. Mrs. Gardiner.

544
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,170
Good day, Miss Bennet.
