1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,263
I knew it would come out right
in the end!

2
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,725
My dear, dear Lydia! She will be married.

3
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:04,315
My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be.
I knew he would manage everything!

4
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,944
Oh, but the clothes! And of course she must
be married from Longbourn.

5
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,323
This is all nonsense
about her being married from Cheapside!

6
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,993
She must be married in Longbourn church,
where her friends can see her.

7
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,537
That is not possible. You must see that.

8
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,042
I do not see that! Why should I see that?
Why should that be?

9
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:28,297
She's been living with Mr. Wickham in London.
If she were to arrive home unmarried still...

10
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:33,511
I suppose it must be, if you put it like that!
But it is all very vexing.

11
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:38,390
Your uncle has been most highhanded!
Why should he take so much upon him?

12
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,519
Mamma, we're greatly indebted to Mr. Gardiner.

13
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:46,357
He must have laid out a great deal of money
to pay off Mr. Wickham's debts.

14
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:49,527
- More than we can ever repay.
- Why should he not?

15
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:52,822
- Who else should lay out money, but her uncle?
- Mother!

16
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:58,702
Oh, well! I am so happy!
A daughter married. And only just sixteen.

17
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,706
"Mrs. Wickham." Oh, how well that sounds!

18
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,209
Oh, but the wedding clothes!

19
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:09,755
Lizzy, go down to your father
and ask how much he will give her.

20
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:17,304
Oh, Jane, as soon as I am dressed
I shall go to Meryton and tell my sister Philips!

21
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:23,352
Ring the bell for Hill! An airing
will do me a great deal of good, I'm sure.

22
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:28,732
And I shall call on Lady Lucas
and Mrs. Long. Oh, Jane!

23
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:32,903
- Papa.
- Jane, it's such wonderful news!

24
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:38,576
Oh, where is Hill?
Oh, Hill, have you heard the good news?

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,828
Shut the door, Lizzy.

26
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,498
And you shall have a bowl of punch
to make merry at...

27
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,673
Someone, at least,
finds pleasure in these events.

28
00:02:54,091 --> 00:03:00,764
But considering what we thought
only a few hours ago, it's not so bad, is it?

29
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,855
- Do you think my uncle paid out much money?
- I do.

30
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,109
Wickham's a fool if he takes her
with a farthing less than 10,000 pounds.

31
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,529
10,000 pounds!

32
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:21,827
Heaven forbid!
How is half such a sum to be repaid?

33
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:26,832
I wish I had laid by an annual sum to bribe
worthless young men to marry my daughters,

34
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,667
but I have not, I confess.

35
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,257
The reason was, of course,
that I intended to father a son.

36
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:40,179
The son would inherit the estate,
no part of which would be entailed away,

37
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:44,058
so providing for my widow
and any other children.

38
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:51,190
By the time we had abandoned hope of producing
an heir, it seemed a little late to begin saving.

39
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:56,695
- You could not have foreseen this, Father.
- I should have taken better care of you all.

40
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:02,451
The satisfaction of prevailing upon
one of the most worthless young men in Britain,

41
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,246
might then have rested in its proper place.

42
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,834
As it is, the thing is done with extraordinarily
little inconvenience to myself.

43
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,130
When you take into account what I shall save
on Lydia's board and pocket allowance,

44
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,466
I am scarcely ten pounds a year worse off.

45
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,888
I am heartily ashamed of myself, Lizzy.

46
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,517
But don't despair, it'll pass.

47
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,021
And no doubt more quickly than it should.

48
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,009
Where is everyone?

49
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:26,160
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here in the sight of God.

50
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:30,789
Mr. Wickham is to resign from the militia
and go into a northern regiment.

51
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,959
Happily there are still some
among his former friends

52
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,713
who are willing to assist him
in purchasing a commission.

53
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:43,594
I have written to Colonel Forster to request that
he will satisfy Wickham's creditors in Brighton,

54
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,220
for which I've pledged myself.

55
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:51,894
"Perhaps you will be so good as to do the same
for his creditors in Meryton,

56
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:58,192
"of whom I enclose a list
according to his information.

57
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,489
"I hope, at least, he has not deceived us."
Let us all hope so.

58
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:08,827
"As soon as they are married, they will journey
directly to join his regiment in Newcastle,

59
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,374
"unless they are first invited to Longbourn."

60
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:17,419
Oh, yes, my dear Mr. Bennet,
of course they must come here!

61
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:22,674
I long to see my dear Lydia!
And dear Wickham, too, of course.

62
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,179
But it is shocking that poor Lydia
should have been sent away from Brighton.

63
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,349
Such a favorite among all the officers!

64
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,977
There were several young men there
that she liked very much.

65
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,733
They will miss her as much as she will miss them.
These northern officers may not be so pleasant.

66
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:44,113
My dear Mrs. Bennet, I'm sure our
youngest daughter will have no difficulty

67
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,698
in finding friends as silly as she is in Newcastle.

68
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:50,536
She has a talent for making a spectacle
of herself wherever she goes.

69
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:55,707
If they are to leave Brighton, they should come to
Hertfordshire and reside in the neighborhood.

70
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,461
Haye Park might do,
if the Gouldings would quit it.

71
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,965
Or the great house at Stoke,
if the drawing-rooms were larger.

72
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,387
- Or Purvis Lodge.
- Oh, no dear, not Purvis Lodge!

73
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,722
The attics there are dreadful!

74
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:17,104
Mrs. Bennet, before you take any, or all of these
houses, let us come to a right understanding.

75
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:21,066
Into one house in the neighborhood
they shall never have admittance.

76
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,863
Mr. and Mrs. Wickham
will never be welcome to Longbourn.

77
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,887
Lord! It seems an age since we were
at Longbourn. Here you all are, just the same!

78
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:54,016
My dear, dear Lydia, at last!

79
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:59,188
Oh, I do believe you've grown!
Oh, how we have missed you.

80
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,107
We've been far too merry
to miss any of you!

81
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,154
Here we are.
Haven't I caught myself a handsome husband?

82
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,242
Indeed you have, my love!
You are very welcome, sir.

83
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,079
You are all goodness and kindness, ma'am,
as always.

84
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,499
Oh, let me give you a kiss, then!

85
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,505
Well, shall we go in?

86
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,347
No, Jane. I take your place now.

87
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,975
You must go lower,
because I am a married woman.

88
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,145
"Mrs. Wickham!"

89
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,440
Lord, how droll that sounds!

90
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,796
How do you like my husband, Lizzy?

91
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,341
I believe you envy me.
Was he not a favorite of yours once?

92
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,261
Not at all, I assure you.

93
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,557
A pity we didn't all go to Brighton.
I could have got husbands for all my sisters!

94
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,645
Thank you, but I don't particularly like
your way of getting husbands.

95
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,734
Isn't my husband a fine horseman?

96
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,990
Colonel Forster said he has as good a seat
as any officer in the regiment.

97
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,578
I wished he could wear his red coat
at the wedding,

98
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,080
and have a guard of honor with their sabers drawn,

99
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,749
but the officers could not be spared from duty.

100
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,253
There was no one there
but my aunt and uncle and Mr. Darcy.

101
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,839
Mr. Darcy?

102
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,679
- Mr. Darcy was at your wedding?
- Oh, yes. Someone had to be groomsman.

103
00:09:56,054 --> 00:10:00,809
I had much rather it had been Denny
or one of our friends... Oh, Lord!

104
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,563
Oh, Lord, I forgot.

105
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:08,358
I wasn't to say a word!
And I promised them so faithfully.

106
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,777
What'll Wickham say now?

107
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,281
It was supposed to be a secret!

108
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:27,419
"My dear Aunt, pray write and let me
understand how he should have been there.

109
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:31,757
"Unless you, too, are bound in the secrecy
which Lydia seems to think necessary."

110
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:37,638
My dear niece, I must confess myself
surprised by your letter.

111
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:42,225
If you are in ignorance of the part that Mr. Darcy
played in bringing about the marriage,

112
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:48,315
let me enlighten you at once.
Mr. Darcy paid us an unexpected visit...

113
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:53,445
"..and so, my dear Lizzy,
Mr. Darcy would brook no opposition.

114
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,825
"He insisted on doing everything himself
and bearing the entirety of the expense.

115
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,621
"Nothing was to be done
that he did not do himself.

116
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,208
"Your uncle, instead of being allowed
to be of use to his niece,

117
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,794
"was forced to put up with having the credit of it."

118
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,046
I must be allowed to insist on this.

119
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,633
The fault is mine, and so must the remedy be.

120
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,220
It was through my mistaken pride,
my reserve,

121
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:22,057
that Mr. Wickham's character
has not been made known to the world.

122
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,811
Had I not thought it beneath me
to lay my private actions open,

123
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,690
his character would have been exposed
and this elopement could never have taken place.

124
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:33,318
Mr. Darcy, I really believe you take
too much upon yourself.

125
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:38,156
I must insist on this, sir. I assure you
that in this matter, argument is fruitless.

126
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,328
The responsibility is mine. I must have it, sir.
I shall not give way.

127
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,461
My dear sister.

128
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:57,342
- I'm afraid I'm interrupting your solitary reverie.
- You are, indeed.

129
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,054
But it doesn't follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.

130
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,684
I should be sorry if it were.
You and I were always good friends.

131
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,645
True.

132
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,233
Then shall we take a turn together, sister?

133
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,658
I was surprised to see Darcy
in town last month.

134
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,745
We passed each other several times.

135
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,956
I wonder what he could be doing there.

136
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,836
Perhaps preparing for the wedding...
with Miss de Bourgh.

137
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,547
Yes. Yes, perhaps.

138
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,717
Must have been something particular,
to take him there this time of year.

139
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,510
Undoubtedly.

140
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:49,895
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?
I understood from the Gardiners that you had.

141
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,355
Yes. He introduced us to his sister.

142
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,902
- Did you like her?
- Yes, very much indeed.

143
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,990
Well, I have heard that she is uncommonly
improved within this last year or two.

144
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,243
When I last saw her,
she was not very promising.

145
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,580
I'm glad you liked her.
I hope she'll turn out well.

146
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,918
I dare say she will.
She has got over the most trying age.

147
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,422
- Did you go by Kympton?
- I don't recollect...

148
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,884
I mention it because it was the living
I should have had.

149
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,679
How should you have liked
making sermons?

150
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,891
Exceedingly well.

151
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,354
I did hear that there was a time
when sermon making was not so palatable to you

152
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,356
as it seem to be at present.

153
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:40,946
That you actually declared your resolution of never
taking orders and were compensated accordingly.

154
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,781
Well...

155
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,620
Oh come, Mr. Wickham,
we are brother and sister, you know.

156
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,790
Let us not quarrel about the past.

157
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:25,407
- Oh, Lydia, when shall we meet again?
- Not these two or three years, perhaps.

158
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:30,078
Not these two or three years.
Oh, what shall I do?

159
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:34,499
And Mr. Bennet is so cruel as to refuse to take us
into the North Country!

160
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,879
- I should refuse to go in any case.
- Hold your tongue, girl! Who asked you?

161
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,382
Oh, Lydia!
You will write to me often, won't you?

162
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:47,095
I don't know. We married women
don't have much time for writing.

163
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,849
My sisters may write to me.
They will have nothing better to do.

164
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:57,063
- Oh, Lydia! Mr. Wickham, take care of my girl!
- I shall, ma'am, to the very best of my ability.

165
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:03,320
And thank you, ma'am, and to you, sir,
for your continued kindness and hospitality.

166
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:08,992
And to you, my dear sisters-in-law.
And now as dear to me as sisters ever could be.

167
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:15,665
But, the carriage awaits. Duty and honor
call me to the North. So, come, my dear!

168
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:26,176
Let us say not farewell,
but as the French have it: Au revoir!

169
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,979
He's as fine a fellow as ever I saw!

170
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,732
He simpers and smirks,
and makes love to us all.

171
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:48,156
I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even
Sir William Lucas to produce such a son-in-law.

172
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,023
Sister! Sister!
Have you heard the news?

173
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:08,319
Mr. Bingley is coming back to Netherfield,
and the whole town is talking of it.

174
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,846
I do assure you,
this news does not affect me, truly, Lizzy.

175
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:40,810
I am glad of one thing.
That he doesn't bring any ladies.

176
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,856
If it is merely a shooting party,
we shall not see him often.

177
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:51,196
Not that I am afraid of myself...
but I dread other people's remarks, Lizzy.

178
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,992
Then I shall venture none...
however sorely I am tempted.

179
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:03,792
It is hard that the man can't come to a house he's
legally rented, without raising all this speculation.

180
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,752
That is just what I think.

181
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,506
- Then we shall leave him to himself.
- Yes.

182
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,846
Stop it, Lizzy.

183
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:25,188
Three days he has been in the neighborhood,
and still he shuns us!

184
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:30,443
I say it's all your father's fault!
He would not do his duty and call,

185
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,363
so you shall all die old maids,

186
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,117
and we shall be turned out by the Collinses
to starve in the hedgerows!

187
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:41,871
You promised last year that if I went to see him,
he'd marry one of my daughters,

188
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:46,876
but it all came to nothing.
I won't be sent on a fool's errand again!

189
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,089
Mammal Mamma, look!
I think he is coming!

190
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,057
Is it really him?
I believe it must be!

191
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,018
He is come, Jane! He is come at last.

192
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:08,523
- Put on your blue gown. No, stay where you are!
- Who's with him?

193
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,985
I don't know, dear.
Some acquaintance, I suppose!

194
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,279
It looks like that man
who used to be with him before.

195
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,365
Mr... You know, that tall proud one.

196
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,202
Mr. Darcy!

197
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,246
I believe it is.

198
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:28,376
Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always
be welcome here, to be sure.

199
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:33,214
But I must say I hate the sight of him!
But I've determined to be civil.

200
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:39,262
If only because the man is a friend of Bingley's,
but no more than civil. Sit up straight, Jane!

201
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,514
Pull your shoulders back.

202
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:46,686
A man could go a long way without seeing
a figure like yours, if you'd make the most of it.

203
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,114
Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, ma'am.

204
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:08,708
- Mr. Bingley, you are very, very welcome.
- How do you do, Mrs. Bennet. I...

205
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,629
It's far too long since you were here,
and very kind of you to call.

206
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:17,884
Mr. Bennet, of course, would have paid
his addresses before this, were it not...

207
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,638
Well, here you are! I am delighted!

208
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,642
And Mr. Darcy, you are welcome, too.

209
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,985
We began to be afraid
you would never come back again.

210
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,490
People did say you meant
to quit the place entirely by Michaelmas

211
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,034
but I hope, however, that is not true.

212
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,161
Ring the bell for tea, Kitty.

213
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,790
A great many changes have taken place
since you went away.

214
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,835
Miss Lucas is married.
And one of my own daughters!

215
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:57,840
- You've heard of it or read it in the papers?
- Yes, indeed...

216
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:03,304
It was not put in properly. It only said: "Lately,
George Wickham, Esquire to Miss Lydia Bennet",

217
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,517
without a syllable said about who her father was,
or where she lived!

218
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:12,397
Now they are gone to Newcastle, and there
they are to stay. I don't know how long.

219
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,024
I expect you've heard he's gone
into the regulars.

220
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:21,114
Thank Heaven he has some friends,
though perhaps not as many as he deserves!

221
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,536
Do you mean to stay long in the neighborhood
on this visit?

222
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,081
Our plans are not yet firmly settled,

223
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:34,669
but I hope,
I hope we shall stay some weeks.

224
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,215
I hope very much
we shall stay a few weeks.

225
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:45,430
- At the very least.
- Well, when you have killed all your own birds,

226
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:50,018
I beg you would come here and shoot
as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor.

227
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,937
I'm sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you!

228
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,818
I suppose you may bring your friends,
if you will.

229
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,544
Now that this first meeting is over,
I feel at ease.

230
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,463
Good!

231
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:23,676
Now I know my own strength, and I shall never
again be embarrassed by his coming.

232
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:29,474
We shall be able to meet now as...
common and indifferent acquaintances.

233
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,437
Yes, very indifferent! Jane, take care.

234
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,900
Don't think me to be in any danger now, Lizzy.

235
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:44,572
I think you are in very great danger of making him
as much in love with you as ever.

236
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:59,670
You tell me now that she was in London
all those months? And you concealed it from me?

237
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:03,007
Yes. I can offer no justification.

238
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:08,471
It was an arrogant presumption, based on a failure
to recognize your true feelings and Miss Bennet's.

239
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:16,270
I should never have interfered.
It was very wrong of me, Bingley, and I apologize.

240
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:20,650
- Do you admit that you were in the wrong?
- Utterly and completely.

241
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,820
Then... I have your blessing?

242
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,322
Do you need my blessing?

243
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:31,160
No. But I should like to know I have it
all the same.

244
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,703
Then go to it.

245
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:54,350
Bring me my horse at once.
Quick, man!

246
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:04,944
Jane!

247
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,655
Jane! Oh, my dear Jane!

248
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,951
- Mamma, what's the matter?
- He is come!

249
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,413
- Who is come?
- Mr. Bingley, of course!

250
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:20,710
Make haste, make haste, hurry down!
Oh, gracious, you are not half dressed!

251
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,920
Hill! Hill!

252
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,798
Oh, where is Hill?

253
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:33,139
Never mind, Sarah. You must come to
Miss Bennet this moment!

254
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:37,810
- Come along and help her on with her gown!
- Mamma! Mamma!

255
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:41,981
Where is my new locket that Lydia brought me?
Mary, have you seen it?

256
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:45,276
I shouldn't know it if I saw it.
I care nothing for such baubles.

257
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:50,990
Oh, never mind your locket, girl!
Jane, stir yourself. He is here, he is here!

258
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:55,578
We will be down as soon as we can.
Let Kitty go down, she is forwarder than us.

259
00:24:55,703 --> 00:25:00,082
Hang Kitty! What has she to do with it?
Jane, be quick!

260
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,335
Where is your muslin dress?

261
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,047
Hill! Hill! Where is Hill?

262
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:19,477
- So Mr. Darcy has gone to town?
- Yes, ma'am. He left quite early this morning.

263
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,333
What's the matter, mamma?

264
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,418
Why do you keep winking at me?

265
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:50,216
- What am I to do?
- Wink at you? Why should I wink at you, child?

266
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:54,887
What a notion! Why should I be winking
at my own daughter, pray?

267
00:25:56,681 --> 00:26:02,520
But now you ask, it puts me in mind.
I do have something I would speak to you about.

268
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,523
Come, come with me.

269
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,651
And you, Mary. Come!

270
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,673
Miss Elizabeth...

271
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,593
You're needed upstairs.

272
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:09,045
Please let me go to Jane.
I promised I would stay with her.

273
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,549
Stay where you are.
Five more minutes will do the trick.

274
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:38,658
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- No. No, don't go, Lizzy.

275
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:52,588
Well?

276
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,717
Oh, Lizzy!

277
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,138
I'm so happy! It is too much!

278
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,850
It is too much!
Why can't everyone be as happy as I am?

279
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,606
He loves me, Lizzy. He loves me!

280
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,566
Of course he does!

281
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:16,028
He told me he loved me all the time.
He didn't believe...

282
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,740
I must tell mamma.
He is gone to papa already!

283
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:25,204
Oh, Lizzy, could you believe
things would end in this happy way?

284
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:30,209
- I could, and I do!
- I must go to my mother.

285
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,169
Oh, Lizzy!

286
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:36,298
To know I shall be giving such pleasure
to all my dear family!

287
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,427
How shall I bear so much happiness?

288
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:04,034
Come back tomorrow, sir, if you can bear to.
Come and shoot with me, if you will.

289
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,122
There are few men
whose society I can tolerate with equanimity.

290
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:12,668
- I believe you may turn out to be be one of them.
- Thank you, sir. I shall be very happy to.

291
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,212
Very well, very well. Get along with you.

292
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,346
Till tomorrow, then!

293
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:38,944
Jane, congratulations.
You will be a very happy woman.

294
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,738
Thank you, father.

295
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:45,409
- I believe I shall.
- Well, well, you're a good girl.

296
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,996
I've no doubt you'll do very well together.

297
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,167
You're each of you so complying
that nothing will ever be resolved on.

298
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,420
- Papa!
- So easy that every servant will cheat you!

299
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:00,716
- No, indeed!
- So generous that you will exceed your income.

300
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,594
Exceed their income!
What are you talking about?

301
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,890
Don't you know he has 5,000 a year?!

302
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:13,562
Oh, my dear, dear Jane! I am so happy!

303
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:19,068
Oh, I knew how it would be! I was sure you
could not be so beautiful for nothing.

304
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,780
He is the handsomest man
that was ever seen!

305
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:34,124
Oh, Lizzy.
If only I could see you as happy.

306
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,087
If there were only such another man for you.

307
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,757
If you were to give me 40 such men...

308
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,052
I could never be as happy as you.

309
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,265
Till I have your goodness,
I can never have your happiness.

310
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:55,020
But...perhaps if I have very good luck,

311
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,107
I may in time meet with another Mr. Collins.

312
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:24,466
Mamma, Lizzy, come and look!
The most enormous carriage has arrived.

313
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,684
What an extremely small hall!

314
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,521
If you'll wait here, your ladyship,
I'll tell my mistress you're here.

315
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,482
No, I will not wait!

316
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:43,819
Where is she?
Is this the drawing-room?

317
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,907
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

318
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:10,262
That lady, I suppose, is your mother.

319
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:15,517
Yes, she is. Mamma, this is
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

320
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:21,190
And that, I suppose, is one of your sisters.

321
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:28,322
Yes, ma'am. She is my youngest girl but one.
My youngest of all is lately married.

322
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,700
You have a very small park here.

323
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:39,291
And this must be a most inconvenient
sitting-room for the evening in summer.

324
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,711
Why, the windows are full west.

325
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:49,051
Indeed, they are, your ladyship,
but we never sit in here after dinner.

326
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,179
- We have...
- Miss Bennet.

327
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:58,936
There seemed to be a prettyish kind of
little wilderness on one side of your lawn.

328
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:01,522
I should be glad to take a turn in it...

329
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:06,068
if you would favor me with your company.

330
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:37,433
You can be at no loss to understand
the reason for my journey, Miss Bennet.

331
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:43,981
You are mistaken, madam. I'm quite unable
to account for the honor of seeing you here.

332
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:49,069
Miss Bennet, you ought to know
I am not to be trifled with.

333
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:53,866
But however insincere you choose to be,
you shall not find me so.

334
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,954
A report of an alarming nature
reached me two days ago.

335
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:04,668
I was told, not only that your sister
was to be most advantageously married,

336
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,671
but that you, Miss Elizabeth Bennet,

337
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:12,134
would be soon afterwards united
to my nephew Mr. Darcy!

338
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,889
Though I know it must be
a scandalous falsehood,

339
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:22,186
I instantly resolved on setting off for this place,
to make my sentiments known to you.

340
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:27,191
If you believed it to be impossible, I wonder what
your ladyship would propose by coming here?

341
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:32,029
At once to insist upon having such a report
universally contradicted!

342
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:36,909
Your coming to Longbourn will be taken as
a confirmation of it, if such a report exists.

343
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:41,538
This is not to be borne.
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied!

344
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:46,543
- Has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?
- Your ladyship declared it to be impossible.

345
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,881
It ought to be so,
but your arts and allurements

346
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:54,802
may have made him forget
what he owes to himself and the family.

347
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:59,973
- You may have drawn him in!
- If I had, I should be the last to confess it.

348
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,977
Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?

349
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:09,149
I have not been accustomed
to such language as this.

350
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:16,240
I am almost the nearest relation he has,
and I am entitled to know all his nearest concerns.

351
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:20,744
But not to know mine, nor will such behavior
as this induce me to be explicit.

352
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,039
Let me be rightly understood.

353
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:29,586
This match, to which you have the presumption
to aspire, can never take place.

354
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:34,174
Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
Now, what have you to say?

355
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,593
Only this: that if he is so,

356
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,721
you can have no reason
to suppose he'll make an offer to me.

357
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,433
The engagement between them
is of a peculiar kind.

358
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,979
From their infancy
they have been intended for each other.

359
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:51,108
It was the favorite wish of his mother
as well as hers.

360
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,903
While she was in her cradle,
we planned the union.

361
00:35:55,028 --> 00:36:01,743
And now to be prevented by the upstart
pretensions of a young woman without family,

362
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:07,207
connections or fortune?
Is this to be endured? It shall not be!

363
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,128
Your alliance would be a disgrace!

364
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:15,257
Your name would never even be mentioned
by any of us.

365
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,926
These would be heavy misfortunes, indeed.

366
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:22,598
Obstinate, headstrong girl!
I am ashamed of you.

367
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,019
I have not been in the habit
of brooking disappointment!

368
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:32,149
That will make your ladyship's situation at present
more pitiable, but it will have no effect on me.

369
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:35,194
I will not be interrupted!

370
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,529
If you were sensible,

371
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,325
you would not wish to quit the sphere
in which you have been brought up!

372
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:47,497
Lady Catherine, in marrying your nephew I should
not consider myself as quitting that sphere.

373
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:51,335
He's a gentleman, I'm a gentleman's daughter.
So far we are equal.

374
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,257
But who was your mother? Your uncles and aunts?
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.

375
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:02,262
If your nephew does not object to my connections,
they can be nothing to you.

376
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:07,059
Tell me once and for all,
are you engaged to him?

377
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,146
I am not.

378
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:19,488
And will you promise me
never to enter into such an engagement?

379
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,574
I will make no promise of the kind,

380
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:26,453
and I beg you
not to importune me any further on the subject.

381
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:31,541
Not so hasty, if you please!
I have another objection.

382
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:37,297
Your youngest sister's infamous elopement.
I know it all!

383
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:41,093
Is such a girl to be my nephew's sister-in-law?

384
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,346
Are the shades of Pemberley
to be thus polluted?

385
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,307
You can have nothing further to say.

386
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,186
You have insulted me
by every possible method.

387
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,563
I must beg to return to the house.

388
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:59,820
You have no regard then,
for the honor and credit of my nephew?

389
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,824
Unfeeling, selfish girl!

390
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,202
You refuse to oblige me?

391
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:13,375
You refuse the claims of duty,
honor, gratitude?

392
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:21,174
You are determined to ruin him,
and make him the contempt of the world!

393
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,429
I am only resolved to act in a manner
which will constitute my own happiness,

394
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:30,684
without reference to you, or to any person
so wholly unconnected with me.

395
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:34,604
And this is your final resolve?

396
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,234
Very well. I shall know how to act!

397
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,537
I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.

398
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:55,751
I send no compliments to your mother.
You deserve no such attention.

399
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:01,590
I am most seriously displeased.
Drive on!

400
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,654
Lizzy, Lizzy! I was going to look for you.
Come into my room.

401
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,874
I received a letter this morning,
which has astonished me exceedingly.

402
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,461
- From Mr. Collins.
- What can he have to say?

403
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:43,423
He begins with congratulations on the approaching
nuptials of my eldest daughter,

404
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:48,178
but I shan't sport with your intelligence
by reading his remarks on that topic.

405
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,597
Ah, yes. Here, here, here.

406
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:55,685
"Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed,
will not long bear the name of Bennet,

407
00:39:55,811 --> 00:40:00,899
"after her elder sister has resigned it,
and the chosen partner of her fate

408
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,946
"may be reasonably looked up to as one of
the most illustrious personages in the land."

409
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:11,034
Can you guess who he means, Lizzy?
Now it comes out.

410
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,121
"My motive for cautioning you is as follows:

411
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:20,168
"his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh,
does not look on the match with a friendly eye."

412
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,632
Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man.
Mr. Darcy of all men!

413
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:31,430
Who never looks at a woman except to see
a blemish! Are you not diverted?

414
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:32,556
Yes.

415
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:36,685
Mr. Darcy, who probably never looked at you
in his life before!

416
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,648
This is admirable!
But Lizzy, you look as if you didn't enjoy it.

417
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:46,570
You're not going to be Missish now,
and pretend to be affronted by an idle report?

418
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:51,074
Oh, no, I am excessively diverted.
It's all so strange.

419
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,246
What said Lady Catherine de Bourgh?
I suppose she came to refuse her consent?

420
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:03,253
What do we live for, but to make sport for
our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?

421
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,423
True, true.

422
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,809
Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, ma'am.

423
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:22,230
- Good day to you!
- Mr. Bingley.

424
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:28,904
This is a fine day.
Should we perhaps all walk to Meryton?

425
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:37,954
Lizzy!

426
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:41,583
Do you mind if I run to call on Maria Lucas?

427
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,377
No, not at all.

428
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,310
Mr. Darcy.

429
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:06,024
I can go no longer without thanking you
for your kindness to my poor sister.

430
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,151
Ever since I have known of it,

431
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:13,865
I've been most anxious
to tell you how grateful I am,

432
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,951
for my family and for myself.

433
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:22,123
You must not blame my aunt for telling me.
Lydia betrayed it first,

434
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,627
and then I couldn't rest till I knew everything.

435
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:31,299
I know what trouble and what mortification
it must have cost you.

436
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:36,596
Please let me say this,
please allow me to thank you,

437
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:41,977
on behalf of all my family, since they don't know
to whom they are indebted.

438
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,481
If you will thank me, let it be for yourself alone.

439
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,150
Your family owes me nothing.

440
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:53,363
As much as I respect them,
I believe I thought only of you.

441
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,534
You're too generous to trifle with me.

442
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,829
If your feelings are what they were last April,
tell me so.

443
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:04,457
My affections and wishes are unchanged.

444
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,254
But one word from you will silence me
on this subject forever.

445
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,632
Oh, my feelings...

446
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,343
My feelings are...

447
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,388
I am ashamed to remember what I said then.

448
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,683
My feelings are so different.

449
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:26,646
In fact, they are quite the opposite.

450
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,704
Lady Catherine told me of her meeting with you.

451
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:49,085
I may say that her disclosure had quite
the opposite effect to the one she had intended.

452
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:53,882
It taught me to hope, that I had scarcely ever
allowed myself to hope before.

453
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:57,969
Had you absolutely decided against me,
you would have acknowledged it openly.

454
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:02,974
Yes, you know enough of my frankness
to believe me capable of that!

455
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:08,438
After abusing you so to your face, I could have no
scruple in abusing you to all your relations.

456
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,899
What did you say of me that I did not deserve?

457
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:16,905
My behavior at the time was unpardonable.
I can hardly think of it without abhorrence.

458
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,659
Your reproof I shall never forget.

459
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:24,788
"Had you behaved in a more
gentleman-like manner."

460
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:27,290
You know not how
those words have tortured me.

461
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,919
I had no idea of their being taken such a way.

462
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:35,715
I can easily believe it. You thought me devoid
of every proper feeling, I am sure.

463
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,677
The turn of your countenance
I shall never forget.

464
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:44,391
You said I could not have addressed you in any
way that would have induced you to accept me.

465
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:47,018
Do not repeat what I said then!

466
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,105
No, I have been a selfish being all my life.

467
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:56,653
As a child I was given good principles,
but was left to follow them in pride and conceit.

468
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,864
And such I might still have been,
but for you.

469
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,077
Dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!

470
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,506
Engaged to Mr. Darcy!

471
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,469
No, you are joking. It is impossible!

472
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:28,059
This is a wretched beginning!
If you don't believe me, I'm sure no one else will.

473
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:34,023
Indeed, I am in earnest.
He still loves me, and we are engaged.

474
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:37,861
It can't be true.
I know how much you dislike him!

475
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:44,367
No, it is all forgotten! Perhaps I didn't always
love him as well as I do now

476
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:49,122
but in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable.

477
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:52,000
Dearest Lizzy, do be serious.

478
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:59,090
- How long have you loved him?
- It's been coming on so gradually, I hardly know.

479
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:05,847
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing
his beautiful grounds at Pemberley!

480
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,017
Lizzy!

481
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:15,607
Are you out of your senses
to be accepting this man, Lizzy?

482
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,195
Have you not always hated him?

483
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:23,740
- Papa...
- I've given him my consent.

484
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:27,869
He's the kind of man, indeed,
to whom I should never dare refuse anything.

485
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:35,210
But let me advise you to think the better of it.
I know your disposition, Lizzy.

486
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:42,884
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you
unable to respect your partner in life.

487
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,430
He is rich, to be sure,
but will he make you happy?

488
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,683
Have you objections apart from your belief
in my indifference?

489
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:55,647
None whatever. We all know him to be
a proud, unpleasant sort of man,

490
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:59,484
but this would be nothing if you really liked him.

491
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:03,238
I do. I do like him.

492
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,491
I love him.

493
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,789
Indeed, he has no improper pride.
He is perfectly amiable.

494
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,918
If you only knew his generous nature.

495
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,755
I didn't always love him,

496
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,925
but I love him now so very dearly.

497
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,304
He is truly the best man I have ever known.

498
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:37,647
Well, my dear, if this be the case,
he deserves you.

499
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,695
I could not have parted with you
to anyone less worthy, Lizzy.

500
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:56,708
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here in the sight of God,

501
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,085
and in the face of this congregation,

502
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:04,382
to join together this man and this woman

503
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,472
and this man and this woman

504
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:16,352
in holy matrimony,
which is an honorable estate,

505
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:20,315
instituted by God
in the time of man's innocency,

506
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:26,237
signifying unto us the mystical union
that is between Christ and His church,

507
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:31,326
and therefore is not by any to be enterprized
lightly, or wantonly,

508
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:35,747
to satisfy man's carnal lusts and appetites,

509
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:41,377
but reverently, discreetly,
advisedly, soberly,

510
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:47,342
and in the fear of God, duly considering
the causes for which matrimony was ordained.

511
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:52,847
First, it was ordained
for the procreation of children.

512
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:57,852
Secondly, as a remedy against sin,

513
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:02,023
and to avoid fornication.

514
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,067
Thirdly,

515
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:10,406
for the mutual society, help and comfort
that the one ought to have of the other,

516
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:14,118
both in prosperity and adversity,

517
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:20,416
into which holy estate these persons present
come now to be joined.

518
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,469
Three daughters married!

519
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:18,349
- Oh, Mr. Bennet, God has been very good to us!
- Yes, so it would seem.
